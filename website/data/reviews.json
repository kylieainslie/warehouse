To name a few:\n\n👉 families: gaussian, binomial, poisson, gamma, inverse gaussian, negative binomial, tweedie\n👉 stationary and non-stationary M-dependent and AR-M-dependent residual covariance structures\n👉 correct weighting for MAR (WGEE) - observation and cluster/subject-specific weights\n👉 Mancl-DeRouen bias-corrected sandwich for small sample inference! Also: standard sandwich, jacknife, df-adjusted, naive model-based\n👉 Model selection criteria like QIC, CIC, RJ, SGPC, GHYC, PAC, AGPC (yes! Akaike-type penalized Gaussian pseudo-likelihood)\n👉 Global and local influence diagnostics; Cook's distance, DFBETA, leverage \n👉 Comparing nested models - stepwise selection (I never recommend it but if you want it - it is there), based on: QIC, QICU, AGPC, SGPC, Wald's and Score p-values\n👉 Pearson, Deviance and Mahalanobis residuals \n👉 nonlinear predictors (gnmgee)!\n\n✔️ doesn't crash! warns about unstable estimates (unlike geepack) \n\n✔️ lots of stuff for the GLM family!\n\n✔️ talks with these packages - essential for clinical trials!\n- broom\n- mice\n- emmeans\n- marginaleffects\n- easystat::insight\n- easystat::parameters\n- ggeffects\n\n Here's the paper: https://lnkd.in/drJ-Kbie",
