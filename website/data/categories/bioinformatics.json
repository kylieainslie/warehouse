SNF is a data integration approach\nthat can transform high-dimensional and diverse data types into\na single similarity network suitable for clustering with\nminimal loss of information from each initial data source. The\nmeta clustering approach was introduced by Caruana et al.\n(2006) in <doi:10.1109/ICDM.2006.103>. Meta clustering involves\ngenerating a wide range of cluster solutions by adjusting\nclustering hyperparameters, then clustering the solutions\nthemselves into a manageable number of qualitatively similar\nsolutions, and finally characterizing representative solutions\nto find ones that are best for the user's specific context.\nThis package provides a framework to easily transform\nmulti-modal data into a wide range of similarity network\nfusion-derived cluster solutions as well as to visualize,\ncharacterize, and validate those solutions. Core package\nfunctionality includes easy customization of distance metrics,\nclustering algorithms, and SNF hyperparameters to generate\ndiverse clustering solutions; calculation and plotting of\nassociations between features, between patients, and between\ncluster solutions; and standard cluster validation approaches\nincluding resampled measures of cluster stability, standard\nmetrics of cluster quality, and label propagation to evaluate\ngeneralizability in unseen data.

The package then uses a decay function to project\nthese signals, creating geodesic paths on a 2D-image space.\n'PathwaySpace' could have various applications, such as\nvisualizing network data in a graphical format that highlights\nthe relationships and signal strengths between vertices. It can\nbe particularly useful for understanding the influence of\nsignals through complex networks. By combining graph theory,\nsignal processing, and visualization, the 'PathwaySpace'\npackage provides a novel way of representing graph data.",

    "description": "A first step in the data analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n(MS) based proteomics data is to identify peptides and\nproteins. With this respect the huge number of experimental\nmass spectra typically have to be assigned to theoretical\npeptides derived from a sequence database. Search engines are\nused for this purpose. These tools compare each of the observed\nspectra to all candidate theoretical spectra derived from the\nsequence data base and calculate a score for each comparison.\nThe observed spectrum is then assigned to the theoretical\npeptide with the best score, which is also referred to as the\npeptide to spectrum match (PSM). It is of course crucial for\nthe downstream analysis to evaluate the quality of these\nmatches. Therefore False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is used\nto return a reliable list PSMs. The FDR, however, requires a\ngood characterisation of the score distribution of PSMs that\nare matched to the wrong peptide (bad target hits). In\nproteomics, the target decoy approach (TDA) is typically used\nfor this purpose. The TDA method matches the spectra to a\ndatabase of real (targets) and nonsense peptides (decoys). A\npopular approach to generate these decoys is to reverse the\ntarget database. Hence, all the PSMs that match to a decoy are\nknown to be bad hits and the distribution of their scores are\nused to estimate the distribution of the bad scoring target\nPSMs. A crucial assumption of the TDA is that the decoy PSM\nhits have similar properties as bad target hits so that the\ndecoy PSM scores are a good simulation of the target PSM\nscores. Users, however, typically do not evaluate these\nassumptions. To this end we developed TargetDecoy to generate\ndiagnostic plots to evaluate the quality of the target decoy\nmethod.",

    "description": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods are typically unable to quantify the expression levels of all genes in a cell, creating a need for the computational prediction of missing values (‘dropout imputation’). Most existing dropout imputation methods are limited in the sense that they exclusively use the scRNA-seq dataset at hand and do not exploit external gene-gene relationship information. Here we propose two novel methods: a gene regulatory network-based approach using gene-gene relationships learnt from external data and a baseline approach corresponding to a sample-wide average. ADImpute can implement these novel methods and also combine them with existing imputation methods (currently supported: DrImpute, SAVER). ADImpute can learn the best performing method per gene and combine the results from different methods into an ensemble.",

AUCell uses the \"Area Under the Curve\" (AUC) to calculate whether a critical subset of the input gene set is enriched within the expressed genes for each cell. The distribution of AUC scores across all the cells allows exploring the relative expression of the signature. Since the scoring method is ranking-based, AUCell is independent of the gene expression units and the normalization procedure. In addition, since the cells are evaluated individually, it can easily be applied to bigger datasets, subsetting the expression matrix if needed.",

Compare this to the naive approach which takes O(N*M) time to loop\n    through each pattern and scan for it in the text. This implementation builds the\n    trie (the generic name of the data structure) and runs the search in a single\n    function call. If you want to search multiple texts with the same trie, the\n    function will take a list or vector of texts and return a list of matches to\n    each text. By default, all 128 ASCII characters are allowed in both the keywords\n    and the text. A more efficient trie is possible if the alphabet size can be\n    reduced. For example, DNA sequences use at most 19 distinct characters and\n    usually only 4; protein sequences use at most 26 distinct characters and usually\n    only 20.

Valid allocations must satisfy no-subsidy constraints, \n    meaning that no group of agents contributes more than the highest cost of \n    its members (i.e., no agent is allowed to subsidize another). A rule is a \n    mechanism that selects an allocation vector for a given problem. This \n    package computes several rules proposed in the literature, including both \n    standard rules and their variants, such as weighted versions, rules for \n    clones, and rules based on the agents’ hierarchy order. These rules can be \n    applied to various problems of interest, including the allocation of \n    liabilities and the maintenance of irrigation systems, among others.  \n    Moreover, the package provides functions for graphical representation, \n    enabling users to visually compare the outcomes produced by each rule, \n    or to display the no-subsidy set.

The fraction next to the category name indicates the fraction of 'good' ASVs in it; 'good' ASVs are the ones exceeding the arbitrary absValue cutoff (option in taxon_mwuPlot()). For Fisher's based test, specify absValue=0.5. This value does not affect statistics and is used for plotting only. The original idea was for genes differential expression analysis from Wright et al (2015) <doi:10.1186/s12864-015-1540-2>; adapted here for taxonomic analysis.\n    The 'Anaconda' package makes it possible to carry out these analyses by automatically creating several graphs and tables and storing them in specially created subfolders. You will need your QIIME2 pipeline output for each kingdom (eg; Fungi and/or Bacteria and/or Metazoan): i) taxonomy.tsv, ii) taxonomy_RepSeq.tsv, iii) ASV.tsv and iv) SampleSheet_comparison.txt (the latter being created by you).",

The identifier history is provided by some resources,\n    such as Ensembl or the NCBI, but it is generally not used by mapping tools.\n    The third challenge is related to the automation of the mapping process\n    according to the relationships between the biological entities of interest.\n    Indeed, mapping between gene and protein ID scopes should not be done\n    the same way than between two scopes regarding gene ID.\n    Also, converting identifiers from different organisms should be possible\n    using gene orthologs information.\n    The method has been published by\n    Godard and van Eyll (2018) <doi:10.12688/f1000research.13925.3>.",

    "description": "Bayes factors represent the ratio of probabilities assigned to data by competing scientific hypotheses. However, one drawback of Bayes factors is their dependence on prior specifications that define null and alternative hypotheses. Additionally, there are challenges in their computation. To address these issues, we define Bayes factor functions (BFFs) directly from common test statistics. BFFs express Bayes factors as a function of the prior densities used to define the alternative hypotheses. These prior densities are centered on standardized effects, which serve as indices for the BFF. Therefore, BFFs offer a summary of evidence in favor of alternative hypotheses that correspond to a range of scientifically interesting effect sizes. Such summaries remove the need for arbitrary thresholds to determine \"statistical significance.\" BFFs are available in closed form and can be easily computed from z, t, chi-squared, and F statistics. They depend on hyperparameters \"r\" and \"tau^2\", which determine the shape and scale of the prior distributions defining the alternative hypotheses. Plots of BFFs versus effect size provide informative summaries of hypothesis tests that can be easily aggregated across studies.",

Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank ('BMRB') is a repository\n        for Data from NMR Spectroscopy on Proteins, Peptides, Nucleic Acids, and other Biomolecules. Currently, 'BMRB' offers an R package \n        'RBMRB' to fetch data, however, it doesn't easily offer individual data file downloading and storing in a local directory. When using \n        'RBMRB', the data will stored as an R object, which fundamentally hinders the NMR researches to access the rich information from raw \n        data, for example, the metadata. Here, 'BMRBr' File Downloader ('BMRBr') offers a more fundamental, low level downloader, which will \n        download original deposited .str format file. This type of file contains information such as entry title, authors, citation, protein\n        sequences, and so on.\n        Many factors affect NMR experiment outputs, such as temperature, resonance sensitivity and etc., approximately 40% of the entries in the 'BMRB' have \n        chemical shift accuracy problems [1,2] Unfortunately, current reference correction methods are heavily dependent on the availability of\n        assigned protein chemical shifts or protein structure. This is my current research project is going to solve, which will be included\n        in the future release of the package. The current version of the package is sufficient and robust enough for downloading individual \n        'BMRB' data file from the 'BMRB' database <http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu>.

    "description": "The kallisto | bustools pipeline is a fast and modular set of tools to convert single cell RNA-seq reads in fastq files into gene count or transcript compatibility counts (TCC) matrices for downstream analysis. Central to this pipeline is the barcode, UMI, and set (BUS) file format. This package serves the following purposes: First, this package allows users to manipulate BUS format files as data frames in R and then convert them into gene count or TCC matrices. Furthermore, since R and Rcpp code is easier to handle than pure C++ code, users are encouraged to tweak the source code of this package to experiment with new uses of BUS format and different ways to convert the BUS file into gene count matrix. Second, this package can conveniently generate files required to generate gene count matrices for spliced and unspliced transcripts for RNA velocity. Here biotypes can be filtered and scaffolds and haplotypes can be removed, and the filtered transcriptome can be extracted and written to disk. Third, this package implements utility functions to get transcripts and associated genes required to convert BUS files to gene count matrices, to write the transcript to gene information in the format required by bustools, and to read output of bustools into R as sparses matrices.",

BioNERO can be used to infer gene coexpression networks (GCNs) and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression data. Additionally, it can be used to explore topological properties of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. GCN inference relies on the popular WGCNA algorithm. GRN inference is based on the \"wisdom of the crowds\" principle, which consists in inferring GRNs with multiple algorithms (here, CLR, GENIE3 and ARACNE) and calculating the average rank for each interaction pair. As all steps of network analyses are included in this package, BioNERO makes users avoid having to learn the syntaxes of several packages and how to communicate between them. Finally, users can also identify consensus modules across independent expression sets and calculate intra and interspecies module preservation statistics between different networks.",

    "description": "\n    Biotechnology in spatial omics has advanced rapidly over the past few years, enhancing both throughput and resolution. However, existing annotation pipelines in spatial omics predominantly rely on clustering methods, lacking the flexibility to integrate extensive annotated information from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) due to discrepancies in spatial resolutions, species, or modalities. Here we introduce the CAESAR suite, an open-source software package that provides image-based spatial co-embedding of locations and genomic features. It uniquely transfers labels from scRNA-seq reference, enabling the annotation of spatial omics datasets across different technologies, resolutions, species, and modalities, based on the conserved relationship between signature genes and cells/locations at an appropriate level of granularity. Notably, CAESAR enriches location-level pathways, allowing for the detection of gradual biological pathway activation within spatially defined domain types. More details on the methods related to our paper currently under submission. A full reference to the paper will be provided in future versions once the paper is published.",

The use of copula functions allows modeling a wide range of multivariate dependencies between the phenotypes, and previous results are supporting that C-JAMP can increase the power of association studies to identify associated genetic variants in comparison to existing methods (Konigorski, Yilmaz, Pischon, 2016, <DOI:10.1186/s12919-016-0045-6>; Konigorski, Yilmaz, Bull, 2014, <DOI:10.1186/1753-6561-8-S1-S72>).

The spending process is usually modelled by a separate probabilistic model. Combining these results yields in \n    lifetime values estimates for individual customers.\n    This package includes fast and accurate implementations of various probabilistic models for non-contractual settings \n    (e.g., grocery purchases or hotel visits). All implementations support time-invariant covariates, which can be used to control for e.g., \n    socio-demographics. If such an extension has been proposed in literature, we further provide the possibility to control for time-varying \n    covariates to control for e.g., seasonal patterns. \n    Currently, the package includes the following latent attrition models to model individuals' attrition and transaction process: \n    [1] Pareto/NBD model (Pareto/Negative-Binomial-Distribution), \n    [2] the Extended Pareto/NBD model (Pareto/Negative-Binomial-Distribution with time-varying covariates), \n    [3] the BG/NBD model (Beta-Gamma/Negative-Binomial-Distribution) and the \n    [4] GGom/NBD (Gamma-Gompertz/Negative-Binomial-Distribution). \n    Further, we provide an implementation of the Gamma/Gamma model to model the spending process of individuals.",

It allows the user to define and infer the expression dynamics of individual and multiple pathways towards distinct phenotypes.",

It provides the flexibility to estimate either classical or robust confidence regions, which can be visualized in 2D or 3D plots. The classical approach assumes normality and uses the mean and covariance matrix to define the confidence regions. Alternatively, the robustified version employs estimators like minimum covariance determinant (MCD) and M-estimator, making them less sensitive to outliers and departures from normality. Furthermore, the functions allow users to group the dataset based on categorical variables and estimate separate confidence regions for each group.

Ongoing large-scale efforts to process and normalize publicly available gene expression data enable rapid and systematic reanalysis. While several powerful tools systematically process RNA-seq data, enabling their reanalysis, few resources systematically recompute differentially expressed genes (DEGs) generated from individual studies. We developed a robust differential expression analysis pipeline to recompute 3162 human DEG lists from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue Expression Consortium, and 142 studies within the Sequence Read Archive. After measuring the accuracy of the recomputed DEG lists, we built the Differential Expression Enrichment Tool (DEET), which enables users to interact with the recomputed DEG lists. DEET, available through CRAN and RShiny, systematically queries which of the recomputed DEG lists share similar genes, pathways, and TF targets to their own gene lists. DEET identifies relevant studies based on shared results with the user’s gene lists, aiding in hypothesis generation and data-driven literature review.

DNA methylation studies have enabled researchers to understand methylation patterns and their regulatory roles in biological processes and disease. However, only a limited number of statistical approaches have been developed to provide formal quantitative analysis. Specifically, a few available methods do identify differentially methylated CpG (DMC) sites or regions (DMR), but they suffer from limitations that arise mostly due to challenges inherent in bisulfite sequencing data. These challenges include: (1) that read-depths vary considerably among genomic positions and are often low; (2) both methylation and autocorrelation patterns change as regions change; and (3) CpG sites are distributed unevenly. Furthermore, there are several methodological limitations: almost none of these tools is capable of comparing multiple groups and/or working with missing values, and only a few allow continuous or multiple covariates. The last of these is of great interest among researchers, as the goal is often to find which regions of the genome are associated with several exposures and traits. To tackle these issues, we have developed an efficient DMC identification method based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) called “DMCHMM” which is a three-step approach (model selection, prediction, testing) aiming to address the aforementioned drawbacks.",

The DNA model captures nonlinear dependencies across fidelity levels using Gaussian process priors and is particularly effective when simulations at different fidelity levels are nonlinearly correlated. The DNA model targets not only interpolation across given fidelity levels but also extrapolation to smaller tuning parameters including the exact solution corresponding to a zero-valued tuning parameter, leveraging a nonseparable covariance kernel structure that models interactions between the tuning parameter and input variables. Closed-form expressions for the predictive mean and variance enable efficient inference and uncertainty quantification. Hyperparameters in the model are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation.

    "description": "Consider ambiguity in probabilistic descriptions by replacing a parametric probabilistic description of uncertainty by a non-parametric set of probability distributions in the form of a Density Ratio Class. This is of particular interest in Bayesian inference.\n    The Density Ratio Class is particularly suited for this purpose as it is invariant under Bayesian inference, marginalization, and propagation through a deterministic model. Here, invariant means that the result of the operation applied to a Density Ratio Class is again a Density Ratio Class. In particular the invariance under Bayesian inference thus enables iterative learning within the same framework of Density Ratio Classes.\n    The use of imprecise probabilities in general, and Density Ratio Classes in particular, lead to intervals of characteristics of probability distributions, such as cumulative distribution functions, quantiles, and means.\n    The package is based on a sample of the distribution proportional to the upper bound of the class. Typically this will be a sample from the posterior in Bayesian inference. Based on such a sample, the package provides functions to calculate lower and upper class boundaries and lower and upper bounds of cumulative distribution functions, and quantiles.\n    Rinderknecht, S.L., Albert, C., Borsuk, M.E., Schuwirth, N., Kuensch, H.R. and Reichert, P.

'DRomics' provides functions 1) to check, normalize and or transform data, 2) to select monotonic or biphasic significantly responding items (e.g. probes, metabolites), 3) to choose the best-fit model among a predefined family of monotonic and biphasic models to describe each selected item, 4) to derive a benchmark dose or concentration and a typology of response from each fitted curve. In the available version data are supposed to be single-channel microarray data in log2, RNAseq data in raw counts, or already pretreated continuous omics data (such as metabolomic data) in log scale. In order to link responses across biological levels based on a common method, 'DRomics' also handles apical data as long as they are continuous and follow a normal distribution for each dose or concentration, with a common standard error.

To most \n    effectively extract information from bulk data given the new knowledge \n    gained from single-cell methods, we have developed a novel algorithm to \n    estimate the cell-type composition of bulk data from a single-cell \n    RNA-seq-derived cell-type signature. Comparison with existing methods using \n    various real RNA-seq data sets indicates that our new approach is more \n    accurate and comprehensive than previous methods, especially for the \n    estimation of rare cell types. More importantly,our method can detect \n    cell-type composition changes in response to external perturbations, \n    thereby providing a valuable, cost-effective method for dissecting the \n    cell-type-specific effects of drug treatments or condition changes. \n    As such, our method is applicable to a wide range of biological and \n    clinical investigations. Dampened weighted least squares ('DWLS') is an \n    estimation method for gene expression deconvolution, in which the cell-type \n    composition of a bulk RNA-seq data set is computationally inferred. \n    This method corrects common biases towards cell types that are \n    characterized by highly expressed genes and/or are highly prevalent, to \n    provide accurate detection across diverse cell types.

The MD-plot outperforms the box-and-whisker diagram (box plot), violin plot and bean plot and geom_violin plot of ggplot2. Furthermore, a collection of various visualization methods for univariate data is provided. In the case of exploratory data analysis, 'DataVisualizations' makes it possible to inspect the distribution of each feature of a dataset visually through a combination of four methods. One of these methods is the Pareto density estimation (PDE) of the probability density function (pdf). Additionally, visualizations of the distribution of distances using PDE, the scatter-density plot using PDE for two variables as well as the Shepard density plot and the Bland-Altman plot are presented here. Pertaining to classified high-dimensional data, a number of visualizations are described, such as f.ex. the heat map and silhouette plot. A political map of the world or Germany can be visualized with the additional information defined by a classification of countries or regions. By extending the political map further, an uncomplicated function for a Choropleth map can be used which is useful for measurements across a geographic area. For categorical features, the Pie charts, slope charts and fan plots, improved by the ABC analysis, become usable.

Computational models, notably DeProViR, predict PPIs from amino acid sequences, incorporating semantic information with GloVe embeddings.

Revealing unknown compound-protein interactions is useful to design a new drug for a target protein by screening candidate compounds. The accurate CPI prediction assists in effective drug discovery process. To identify potential CPI effectively, prediction methods based on machine learning and deep learning have been developed. Data for sequences are provided as discrete symbolic data. In the data, compounds are represented as SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry system) strings and proteins are sequences in which the characters are amino acids. The outcome is defined as a variable that indicates how strong two molecules interact with each other or whether there is an interaction between them. In this package, a deep-learning based model that takes only sequence information of both compounds and proteins as input and the outcome as output is used to predict CPI. The model is implemented by using compound and protein encoders with useful features. The CPI model also supports other modeling tasks, including protein-protein interaction (PPI), chemical-chemical interaction (CCI), or single compounds and proteins. Although the model is designed for proteins, DNA and RNA can be used if they are represented as sequences.",

A greedy algorithm is used to find the possible driver genes, which may mutated in a larger number of patients and these mutations will push the gene expression values of the connected genes to some extreme values.",

Traditional methods like Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) use significance tests based on summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the distributions. This approach lacks power to identify expression differences between groups that show high levels of intra-group heterogeneity. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) algorithm instead computes the \"work\" needed to transform one distribution into another, thus providing a metric of the overall difference in shape between two distributions.

Using cross-validation, the ES-CVTMLE separates the selection of the optimal experiment from the estimation of the ATE for the chosen experiment.

Stimuli are presented as sequence of pairwise comparisons ('contests'), during each of which a rater expresses preference for one stimulus over the other (forced choice). The algorithm for calculating global scores is based on Elo rating, which updates individual scores after each single pairwise contest. Elo rating is widely used to rank chess players according to their performance. Its core feature is that dyadic contests with expected outcomes lead to smaller changes of participants' scores than outcomes that were unexpected. As such, Elo rating is an efficient tool to rate individual stimuli when a large number of such stimuli are paired against each other in the context of experiments where the goal is to rank stimuli according to some characteristic of interest.

An important step in cell clustering is to select a subset of genes (referred to as “features”), whose expression patterns will then be used for downstream clustering. A good set of features should include the ones that distinguish different cell types, and the quality of such set could have significant impact on the clustering accuracy. FEAST is an R library for selecting most representative features before performing the core of scRNA-seq clustering. It can be used as a plug-in for the etablished clustering algorithms such as SC3, TSCAN, SHARP, SIMLR, and Seurat. The core of FEAST algorithm includes three steps: 1. consensus clustering; 2. gene-level significance inference; 3. validation of an optimized feature set.",

Marine fisheries governance and management practices are very essential to ensure the sustainability of the marine resources. A widely accepted resource management strategy towards this is to derive sustainable fish harvest levels based on the status of marine fish stock. Various fish stock assessment models that describe the biomass dynamics using time series data on fish catch and fishing effort are generally used for this purpose. In the scenario of complex multi-species marine fishery in which different species are caught by a number of fishing gears and each gear harvests a number of species make it difficult to obtain the fishing effort corresponding to each fish species. Since the capacity of the gears varies, the effort made to catch a resource cannot be considered as the sum of efforts expended by different fishing gears. This necessitates standardisation of fishing effort in unit base.",

In case of fish, shellfish and its products, the proximate composition consists of four primary constituents - water, protein, fat, and ash (mostly minerals). Fish exhibit significant variation in their chemical makeup based on age, sex, environment, and season, both within the same species and between individual fish. There is minimal fluctuation in the content of ash and protein. The lipid concentration varies remarkably and is inversely correlated with the water content. In case of fish, carbohydrates are present in minor quantity so that are quantified by subtracting total of other components from 100 to get percentage of carbohydrates.",

(2) two numerical methods of fuzzification. (3) a function performing different possibilities of distances, including the signed distance and the generalized signed distance for instance with all its properties. (4) numerical estimations of fuzzy statistical measures such as the variance, the moment, etc. (5) two methods of estimation of the bootstrap distribution of the likelihood ratio in the fuzzy context. (6) an estimation of a fuzzy confidence interval by the likelihood ratio method. (7) testing fuzzy hypotheses and/or fuzzy data by fuzzy confidence intervals in the Kwakernaak - Kruse and Meyer sense. (8) a general method to estimate the fuzzy p-value with fuzzy hypotheses and/or fuzzy data. (9) a method of estimation of global and individual evaluations of linguistic questionnaires.

The current implementation provides functions to perform PC-AiR (Conomos et al., 2015, Gen Epi) and PC-Relate (Conomos et al., 2016, AJHG). PC-AiR performs a Principal Components Analysis on genome-wide SNP data for the detection of population structure in a sample that may contain known or cryptic relatedness. Unlike standard PCA, PC-AiR accounts for relatedness in the sample to provide accurate ancestry inference that is not confounded by family structure. PC-Relate uses ancestry representative principal components to adjust for population structure/ancestry and accurately estimate measures of recent genetic relatedness such as kinship coefficients, IBD sharing probabilities, and inbreeding coefficients. Additionally, functions are provided to perform efficient variance component estimation and mixed model association testing for both quantitative and binary phenotypes.",

If direct matching fails, the 'GNRS' attempts to match to standard and then alternate names using fuzzy matching, but does not perform fuzzing matching of political division codes.

    "title": "Make Biological Sense of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Outputs",
    "description": "Gene Set Enrichment Analysis is a very powerful and interesting computational method that allows an easy correlation between differential expressed genes and biological processes. Unfortunately, although it was designed to help researchers to interpret gene expression data it can generate huge amounts of results whose biological meaning can be difficult to interpret. Many available tools rely on the hierarchically structured Gene Ontology (GO) classification to reduce reundandcy in the results. However, due to the popularity of GSEA many more gene set collections, such as those in the Molecular Signatures Database are emerging. Since these collections are not organized as those in GO, their usage for GSEA do not always give a straightforward answer or, in other words, getting all the meaninful information can be challenging with the currently available tools. For these reasons, GSEAmining was born to be an easy tool to create reproducible reports to help researchers make biological sense of GSEA outputs. Given the results of GSEA, GSEAmining clusters the different gene sets collections based on the presence of the same genes in the leadind edge (core) subset. Leading edge subsets are those genes that contribute most to the enrichment score of each collection of genes or gene sets. For this reason, gene sets that participate in similar biological processes should share genes in common and in turn cluster together. After that, GSEAmining is able to identify and represent for each cluster: - The most enriched terms in the names of gene sets (as wordclouds) - The most enriched genes in the leading edge subsets (as bar plots). In each case, positive and negative enrichments are shown in different colors so it is easy to distinguish biological processes or genes that may be of interest in that particular study.",

    "description": "A multiple-testing procedure for high-dimensional mediation hypotheses. Mediation analysis is of rising interest in epidemiology and clinical trials. Among existing methods for mediation analyses, the popular joint significance (JS) test yields an overly conservative type I error rate and therefore low power. In the R package 'HDMT' we implement a multiple-testing procedure that accurately controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the false discovery rate (FDR) when using JS for testing high-dimensional mediation hypotheses. The core of our procedure is based on estimating the proportions of three component null hypotheses and deriving the corresponding mixture distribution of null p-values. Results of the data examples include better-behaved quantile-quantile plots and improved detection of novel mediation relationships on the role of DNA methylation in genetic regulation of gene expression. With increasing interest in mediation by molecular intermediaries such as gene expression, the proposed method addresses an unmet methodological challenge.

IAT scores are calculated as specified by Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji (2003) <doi:10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.197>.    The output of this function is a data frame that consists of four rows containing the following information: (1) the overall IAT effect size for the participant's dataset, (2) the effect size calculated for odd trials only, (3) the effect size calculated for even trials only, and (4) the proportion of trials with reaction times under 300ms (which is important for exclusion purposes). Items (2) and (3) allow for a measure of the internal consistency of the IAT. Specifically, you can use the subsetted IAT effect sizes for odd and even trials to calculate Cronbach's alpha across participants in the sample.    The input function consists of three arguments. First, indicate the name of the dataset to be analyzed. This is the only required input. Second, indicate the number of trials in your entire IAT (the default is set to 220, which is typical for most IATs). Last, indicate whether congruent trials (e.g., flowers and pleasant) or incongruent trials (e.g., guns and pleasant) were presented first for this participant (the default is set to congruent).    Data files should consist of six columns organized in order as follows: Block (0-6), trial (0-19 for training blocks, 0-39 for test blocks), category (dependent on your IAT), the type of item within that category (dependent on your IAT), a dummy variable indicating whether the participant was correct or incorrect on that trial (0=correct, 1=incorrect), and the participant’s reaction time (in milliseconds).

    "description": "Single Layer Feed-forward Neural networks (SLFNs) have many applications in various fields of statistical modelling, especially for time-series forecasting. However, there are some major disadvantages of training such networks via the widely accepted 'gradient-based backpropagation' algorithm, such as convergence to local minima, dependencies on learning rate and large training time. These concerns were addressed by Huang et al. (2006) <doi:10.1016/j.neucom.2005.12.126>, wherein they introduced the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), an extremely fast learning algorithm for SLFNs which randomly chooses the weights connecting input and hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. It shows good generalized performance, but is still subject to a high degree of randomness. To mitigate this issue, this package uses a dimensionality reduction technique given in Hyvarinen (1999) <doi:10.1109/72.761722>, namely, the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to determine the input-hidden connections and thus, remove any sort of randomness from the algorithm. This leads to a robust, fast and stable ELM model. Using functions within this package, the proposed model can also be compared with an existing alternative based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm given by Pearson (1901) <doi:10.1080/14786440109462720>, i.e., the PCA based ELM model given by Castano et al.

    "description": "Intervention analysis is used to investigate structural changes in data resulting from external events. Traditional time series intervention models, viz. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model with exogeneous variables (ARIMA-X) and Artificial Neural Networks with exogeneous variables (ANN-X), rely on linear intervention functions such as step or ramp functions, or their combinations. In this package, the Gompertz, Logistic, Monomolecular, Richard and Hoerl function have been used as non-linear intervention function. The equation of the above models are represented as: Gompertz: A * exp(-B * exp(-k * t)); Logistic: K / (1 + ((K - N0) / N0) * exp(-r * t)); Monomolecular: A * exp(-k * t); Richard: A + (K - A) / (1 + exp(-B * (C - t)))^(1/beta) and Hoerl: a*(b^t)*(t^c).This package introduced algorithm for time series intervention analysis employing ARIMA and ANN models with a non-linear intervention function.

Data analysis for CRISPR/Cas9 screens is a critical process that includes identifying screen hits and exploring biological functions for these hits in downstream analysis. We have previously developed two algorithms, MAGeCK and MAGeCK-VISPR, to analyze CRISPR/Cas9 screen data in various scenarios. These two algorithms allow users to perform quality control, read count generation and normalization, and calculate beta score to evaluate gene selection performance. In downstream analysis, the biological functional analysis is required for understanding biological functions of these identified genes with different screening purposes. Here, We developed MAGeCKFlute for supporting downstream analysis. MAGeCKFlute provides several strategies to remove potential biases within sgRNA-level read counts and gene-level beta scores. The downstream analysis with the package includes identifying essential, non-essential, and target-associated genes, and performing biological functional category analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and protein complex enrichment analysis of these genes. The package also visualizes genes in multiple ways to benefit users exploring screening data. Collectively, MAGeCKFlute enables accurate identification of essential, non-essential, and targeted genes, as well as their related biological functions. This vignette explains the use of the package and demonstrates typical workflows.",

The function additionally outputs five \n    tables with physico-chemical z-descriptor values (based on Sandberg et al. 1998) for \n    each amino acid position in all sequences in the data set. These tables may be useful \n    for further downstream analyses, such as estimation of MHC supertypes.\n    The BootKmeans() function is a wrapper for the kmeans() function of the 'stats'\n    package, which allows for bootstrapping. Bootstrapping k-estimates may be\n    desirable in data sets, where e.g. BIC- vs. k-values do not produce clear\n    inflection points (\"elbows\"). BootKmeans() performs multiple runs of kmeans() and \n    estimates optimal k-values based on a user-defined threshold of BIC reduction. The \n    method is an automated and bootstrapped version of visually inspecting elbow plots \n    of BIC- vs. k-values.\n    The ClusterMatch() function is a tool for evaluating whether different k-means() \n    clustering models identify similar clusters, and summarize bootstrap model stats as \n    means for different estimated values of k. It is designed to take files produced by \n    the BootKmeans() function as input, but other data can be analyzed if the \n    descriptions of the required data formats are observed carefully.\n    The PapaDiv() function compares parent pairs in the data set and calculate their \n    joint MHC diversity, taking into account sequence variants that occur in both \n    parents.\n    The HpltFind() function infers putative haplotypes from families in the data \n    set. \n    The GetHpltTable() and GetHpltStats() functions evaluate the accuracy of \n    the haplotype inference.\n    The CreateHpltOccTable() function creates a binary (logical) haplotype-sequence \n    occurrence matrix from the output of HpltFind(), for easy overview of which \n    sequences are present in which haplotypes. \n    The HpltMatch() function compares haplotypes to help identify overlapping and \n    potentially identical types.\n    The NestTablesXL() function translates the output from HpltFind() to an Excel \n    workbook, that provides a convenient overview for evaluation and curating of the \n    inferred putative haplotypes.",

    "description": "The understanding of cancer mechanism requires the identification of genes playing a role in the development of the pathology and the characterization of their role (notably oncogenes and tumor suppressors). We present an updated version of the R/bioconductor package called MoonlightR, namely Moonlight2R, which returns a list of candidate driver genes for specific cancer types on the basis of omics data integration. The Moonlight framework contains a primary layer where gene expression data and information about biological processes are integrated to predict genes called oncogenic mediators, divided into putative tumor suppressors and putative oncogenes. This is done through functional enrichment analyses, gene regulatory networks and upstream regulator analyses to score the importance of well-known biological processes with respect to the studied cancer type. By evaluating the effect of the oncogenic mediators on biological processes or through random forests, the primary layer predicts two putative roles for the oncogenic mediators: i) tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and ii) oncogenes (OCGs). As gene expression data alone is not enough to explain the deregulation of the genes, a second layer of evidence is needed. We have automated the integration of a secondary mutational layer through new functionalities in Moonlight2R. These functionalities analyze mutations in the cancer cohort and classifies these into driver and passenger mutations using the driver mutation prediction tool, CScape-somatic. Those oncogenic mediators with at least one driver mutation are retained as the driver genes. As a consequence, this methodology does not only identify genes playing a dual role (e.g. TSG in one cancer type and OCG in another) but also helps in elucidating the biological processes underlying their specific roles. In particular, Moonlight2R can be used to discover OCGs and TSGs in the same cancer type. This may for instance help in answering the question whether some genes change role between early stages (I, II) and late stages (III, IV). In the future, this analysis could be useful to determine the causes of different resistances to chemotherapeutic treatments.",

    "description": "To estimate ecological stochasticity in community assembly. Understanding the community assembly mechanisms controlling biodiversity patterns is a central issue in ecology. Although it is generally accepted that both deterministic and stochastic processes play important roles in community assembly, quantifying their relative importance is challenging. The new index, normalized stochasticity ratio (NST), is to estimate ecological stochasticity, i.e. relative importance of stochastic processes, in community assembly. With functions in this package, NST can be calculated based on different similarity metrics and/or different null model algorithms, as well as some previous indexes, e.g. previous Stochasticity Ratio (ST), Standard Effect Size (SES), modified Raup-Crick metrics (RC). Functions for permutational test and bootstrapping analysis are also included. Previous ST is published by Zhou et al (2014) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1324044111>. NST is modified from ST by considering two alternative situations and normalizing the index to range from 0 to 1 (Ning et al 2019) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1904623116>. A modified version, MST, is a special case of NST, used in some recent or upcoming publications, e.g. Liang et al (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.108023>. SES is calculated as described in Kraft et al (2011) <doi:10.1126/science.1208584>. RC is calculated as reported by Chase et al (2011) <doi:10.1890/ES10-00117.1> and Stegen et al (2013) <doi:10.1038/ismej.2013.93>.

This presents a challenge whenever an interesting set of ncRNAs needs to be analyzed in a functional context. Transcripts located close-by on the genome are often regulated together. This genomic proximity on the sequence can hint to a functional association. We present a tool, NoRCE, that performs cis enrichment analysis for a given set of ncRNAs. Enrichment is carried out using the functional annotations of the coding genes located proximal to the input ncRNAs. Other biologically relevant information such as topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries, co-expression patterns, and miRNA target prediction information can be incorporated to conduct a richer enrichment analysis. To this end, NoRCE includes several relevant datasets as part of its data repository, including cell-line specific TAD boundaries, functional gene sets, and expression data for coding & ncRNAs specific to cancer. Additionally, the users can utilize custom data files in their investigation. Enrichment results can be retrieved in a tabular format or visualized in several different ways. NoRCE is currently available for the following species: human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, worm, and yeast.",

A class of methods to correct for selection bias is to apply a statistical model to predict the units not in the sample (super-population modeling). Other studies use calibration or Statistical Matching (statistically match nonprobability and probability samples). To date, the more relevant methods are weighting by Propensity Score Adjustment (PSA).\n    The Propensity Score Adjustment method was originally developed to construct weights by estimating response probabilities and using them in Horvitz–Thompson type estimators. This method is usually used by combining a non-probability sample with a reference sample to construct propensity models for the non-probability sample. Calibration can be used in a posterior way to adding information of auxiliary variables.\n    Propensity scores in PSA are usually estimated using logistic regression models. Machine learning classification algorithms can be used as alternatives for logistic regression as a technique to estimate propensities.\n    The package 'NonProbEst' implements some of these methods and thus provides a wide options to work with data coming from a non-probabilistic sample.",

It extracts the fundamental structure of the data without the need to build any model to represent it. This 'summary' of the data is arrived at through a process of reduction that can transform the large number of variables into a lesser number that are uncorrelated (i.e. the 'principal components'), while at the same time being capable of easy interpretation on the original data. PCAtools provides functions for data exploration via PCA, and allows the user to generate publication-ready figures. PCA is performed via BiocSingular - users can also identify optimal number of principal components via different metrics, such as elbow method and Horn's parallel analysis, which has relevance for data reduction in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and high dimensional mass cytometry data.",

    "description": "Determining the sample size for adequate power to detect statistical significance is a crucial step at the design stage for high-throughput experiments. Even though a number of methods and tools are available for sample size calculation for microarray and RNA-seq in the context of differential expression (DE), this topic in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing is understudied. Moreover, the unique data characteristics present in scRNA-seq such as sparsity and heterogeneity increase the challenge. We propose POWSC, a simulation-based method, to provide power evaluation and sample size recommendation for single-cell RNA sequencing DE analysis. POWSC consists of a data simulator that creates realistic expression data, and a power assessor that provides a comprehensive evaluation and visualization of the power and sample size relationship.",

Most proteins perform their functions in networks associated with other proteins and other biomolecules. This fact has motivated the development of a variety of experimental methods for the identification of protein interactions. This variety has in turn ushered in the development of numerous different computational approaches for modeling and predicting protein interactions. Sometimes an experiment is aimed at identifying proteins closely related to some interesting proteins. A network based statistical learning method is used to infer the putative functions of proteins from the known functions of its neighboring proteins on a PPI network. This package identifies such proteins often involved in the same or similar biological functions.",

    "package_name": "PhysioIndexR",
    "title": "Physiological and Stress Indices for Crop Evaluation",
    "description": "Crop production systems are increasingly challenged by climate variability, resource limitations, and biotic–abiotic stresses. In this context, stress tolerance indices and physiological trait estimators are essential tools to identify stable and superior genotypes, quantify yield stability under stress versus non-stress conditions, and understand plant adaptive responses. The 'PhysioIndexR' package provides a unified framework to compute commonly used stress indices, physiological traits, and derived metrics that are critical in crop improvement, crop physiology, and other agricultural sciences. The package includes functions to calculate classical stress tolerance indices (See Lamba et al., 2023; <doi:10.1038/s41598-023-37634-8>) such as Tolerance (TOL), Stress Tolerance Index (STI), Stress Susceptibility Percentage Index (SSPI), Yield Index (YI), Yield Stability Index (YSI), Relative Stress Index (RSI), Mean Productivity (MP), Geometric Mean Productivity (GMP), Harmonic Mean (HM), Mean Relative Performance (MRP), and Percent Yield Reduction (PYR), along with a convenience wrapper all_indices() that returns all indices simultaneously. The function mfvst_from_indices() integrates these indices into a composite stress score using direction-aware membership values (0–1 scaling) and also averaging, facilitating genotype ranking and selection (See Vinu et al., 2025; <doi:10.1007/s12355-025-01595-1>). The package also implements two novel composite functions: WMFVST(), which computes the Weighted Mean Membership Function Value for Stress Tolerance, and WASI(), which computes the Weighted Average Stress Index, both derived from membership function values (MFV) and raw stress index values, respectively. Beyond stress indices, the package provides functions for key physiological traits relevant to sugarcane and other crops: bmap() computes biomass accumulation and partitioning between leaf, cane/shoot, and root fractions. chl() estimates total chlorophyll content from Soil-Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) and Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI) values using validated quadratic models particularly for sugarcane (See Krishnapriya et al., 2020; <doi:10.37580/JSR.2019.2.9.150-163>). ctd() calculates canopy temperature depression (CTD) from ambient and canopy temperatures, an important indicator of transpiration efficiency. growth() computes key growth analysis parameters, including Leaf Area Index (LAI), Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), and Crop Growth Rate (CGR) across crop growth stages (See Watson, 1958; <doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a083596>). ranking() provides flexible ranking utilities for genotype performance with multiple tie-handling and NA-placement options. Through these tools, the package enables researchers to: (i) quantify crop responses to stress environments, (ii) partition physiological components of yield, (iii) integrate multiple indices into composite metrics for genotype evaluation, and (iv) facilitate informed decision making in breeding pipelines, and plant physiology experiments. By combining physiology-based traits with quantitative stress indices, 'PhysioIndexR' supports comprehensive crop evaluation and helps researchers identify multi-stress-resilient superior genotypes, thereby contributing to genetic improvement and ensuring sustainable production of food, fuel, and fibre in the era of limited resources and climate change.",

Finally, the function PostPrInDT() \n    allows for a posterior analysis of the distribution of a specified variable in the terminal \n    nodes of a given tree.\n    In version 2, additionally structured sampling is implemented in functions PrInDTCstruc() and \n    PrInDTRstruc(). In these functions, repeated measurements data can be analyzed, too. \n    Moreover, multilabel 2-stage versions of classification and regression trees are \n    implemented in functions C2SPrInDT() and R2SPrInDT() as well as interdependent \n    multilabel models in functions SimCPrInDT() and SimRPrInDT(). Finally, for mixtures of \n    classification and regression models functions Mix2SPrInDT() and SimMixPrInDT() are \n    implemented. Most of these extensions of PrInDT are described in Buschfeld & \n    Weihs (2025Fc).\n    References:\n    -- Buschfeld, S., Weihs, C.

    "description": "\n    For QTL mapping, this package comprises several functions designed to execute diverse \n    tasks, such as simulating or analyzing data, calculating significance thresholds, and \n    visualizing QTL mapping results. The single-QTL or multiple-QTL method, which enables \n    the fitting and comparison of various statistical models, is employed to analyze the \n    data for estimating QTL parameters. The models encompass linear regression, permutation \n    tests, normal mixture models, and truncated normal mixture models. The Gaussian stochastic \n    process is utilized to compute significance thresholds for QTL detection on a genetic \n    linkage map within experimental populations. Two types of data, complete genotyping, and \n    selective genotyping data from various experimental populations, including backcross, F2, \n    recombinant inbred (RI) populations, and advanced intercrossed (AI) populations, are \n    considered in the QTL mapping analysis. For QTL hotspot detection, statistical methods can \n    be developed based on either utilizing individual-level data or summarized data. We have \n    proposed a statistical framework capable of handling both individual-level data and \n    summarized QTL data for QTL hotspot detection. Our statistical framework can overcome the \n    underestimation of thresholds resulting from ignoring the correlation structure among \n    traits. Additionally, it can identify different types of hotspots with minimal computational \n    cost during the detection process. Here, we endeavor to furnish the R codes for our QTL \n    mapping and hotspot detection methods, intended for general use in genes, genomics, and \n    genetics studies. The QTL mapping methods for the complete and selective genotyping designs \n    are based on the multiple interval mapping (MIM) model proposed by Kao, C.-H. , Z.-B. Zeng \n    and R. D. Teasdale (1999) <doi: 10.1534/genetics.103.021642> and H.-I Lee, H.-A. Ho and \n    C.-H. Kao (2014) <doi: 10.1534/genetics.114.168385>, respectively.

    "description": "QuaternaryProd is an R package that performs causal reasoning on biological networks, including publicly available networks such as STRINGdb. QuaternaryProd is an open-source alternative to commercial products such as Inginuity Pathway Analysis. For a given a set of differentially expressed genes, QuaternaryProd computes the significance of upstream regulators in the network by performing causal reasoning using the Quaternary Dot Product Scoring Statistic (Quaternary Statistic), Ternary Dot product Scoring Statistic (Ternary Statistic) and Fisher's exact test (Enrichment test). The Quaternary Statistic handles signed, unsigned and ambiguous edges in the network. Ambiguity arises when the direction of causality is unknown, or when the source node (e.g., a protein) has edges with conflicting signs for the same target gene. On the other hand, the Ternary Statistic provides causal reasoning using the signed and unambiguous edges only. The Vignette provides more details on the Quaternary Statistic and illustrates an example of how to perform causal reasoning using STRINGdb.",

RSP provides a powerful markup for controlling the content and output of LaTeX, HTML, Markdown, AsciiDoc, Sweave and knitr documents (and more), e.g. 'Today's date is <%=Sys.Date()%>'.  Contrary to many other literate programming languages, with RSP it is straightforward to loop over mixtures of code and text sections, e.g. in month-by-month summaries.  RSP has also several preprocessing directives for incorporating static and dynamic contents of external files (local or online) among other things.  Functions rstring() and rcat() make it easy to process RSP strings, rsource() sources an RSP file as it was an R script, while rfile() compiles it (even online) into its final output format, e.g. rfile('report.tex.rsp') generates 'report.pdf' and rfile('report.md.rsp') generates 'report.html'.  RSP is ideal for self-contained scientific reports and R package vignettes.  It's easy to use - if you know how to write an R script, you'll be up and running within minutes.",

    "description": "Cancer is a genetic disease caused by somatic mutations in genes controlling key biological functions such as cellular growth and division. Such mutations may arise both through cell-intrinsic and exogenous processes, generating characteristic mutational patterns over the genome named mutational signatures. The study of mutational signatures have become a standard component of modern genomics studies, since it can reveal which (environmental and endogenous) mutagenic processes are active in a tumor, and may highlight markers for therapeutic response. Mutational signatures computational analysis presents many pitfalls. First, the task of determining the number of signatures is very complex and depends on heuristics. Second, several signatures have no clear etiology, casting doubt on them being computational artifacts rather than due to mutagenic processes. Last, approaches for signatures assignment are greatly influenced by the set of signatures used for the analysis. To overcome these limitations, we developed RESOLVE (Robust EStimation Of mutationaL signatures Via rEgularization), a framework that allows the efficient extraction and assignment of mutational signatures. RESOLVE implements a novel algorithm that enables (i) the efficient extraction, (ii) exposure estimation, and (iii) confidence assessment during the computational inference of mutational signatures.",

Dynamic transcripts are then sorted to non-overlapping groups (time profiles) by the time point of switch up or down. At Step 2, RNA-sense outputs the groups of differentially expressed transcripts, which are up- or downregulated in the mutant compared to the wild-type at each time point. At Step 3, Correlations (Fisher's exact test) between the outputs of Step 1 (switch up- and switch down- time profile groups) and the outputs of Step2 (differentially expressed transcript groups) are calculated.

    "description": "The RNAseqCovarImpute package makes linear model analysis for RNA sequencing read counts compatible with multiple imputation (MI) of missing covariates. A major problem with implementing MI in RNA sequencing studies is that the outcome data must be included in the imputation prediction models to avoid bias. This is difficult in omics studies with high-dimensional data. The first method we developed in the RNAseqCovarImpute package surmounts the problem of high-dimensional outcome data by binning genes into smaller groups to analyze pseudo-independently. This method implements covariate MI in gene expression studies by 1) randomly binning genes into smaller groups, 2) creating M imputed datasets separately within each bin, where the imputation predictor matrix includes all covariates and the log counts per million (CPM) for the genes within each bin, 3) estimating gene expression changes using `limma::voom` followed by `limma::lmFit` functions, separately on each M imputed dataset within each gene bin, 4) un-binning the gene sets and stacking the M sets of model results before applying the `limma::squeezeVar` function to apply a variance shrinking Bayesian procedure to each M set of model results, 5) pooling the results with Rubins’ rules to produce combined coefficients, standard errors, and P-values, and 6) adjusting P-values for multiplicity to account for false discovery rate (FDR). A faster method uses principal component analysis (PCA) to avoid binning genes while still retaining outcome information in the MI models. Binning genes into smaller groups requires that the MI and limma-voom analysis is run many times (typically hundreds). The more computationally efficient MI PCA method implements covariate MI in gene expression studies by 1) performing PCA on the log CPM values for all genes using the Bioconductor `PCAtools` package, 2) creating M imputed datasets where the imputation predictor matrix includes all covariates and the optimum number of PCs to retain (e.g., based on Horn’s parallel analysis or the number of PCs that account for >80% explained variation), 3) conducting the standard limma-voom pipeline with the `voom` followed by `lmFit` followed by `eBayes` functions on each M imputed dataset, 4) pooling the results with Rubins’ rules to produce combined coefficients, standard errors, and P-values, and 5) adjusting P-values for multiplicity to account for false discovery rate (FDR).",

The reactions must be unique and their \n    number must exceed that of the reactants,i.e., reactions >= reactants + 2.  \n            'ReDirection', computes the null space of a user-defined stoichiometry\n    matrix. The spanning non-zero and unique reaction vectors (RVs) are \n    combinatorially summed to generate one or more subspaces recursively.  \n            Every reaction is represented as a sequence of identical components \n    across all RVs of a particular subspace. The terms are evaluated with \n    (biologically relevant bounds, linear maps, tests of convergence, descriptive\n    statistics, vector norms) and the terms are classified into forward-, reverse- \n    and equivalent-subsets. Since, these are mutually exclusive the probability \n    of occurrence is binary (all, 1; none, 0).\n            The combined propensity of a reaction is the p1-norm of the \n    sub-propensities, i.e., sum of the products of the probability and maximum\n    numeric value of a subset (least upper bound, greatest lower bound). This, \n    if strictly positive is the probable rate constant, is used to infer dominant\n    direction and annotate a reaction as \"Forward (f)\", \"Reverse (b)\" or \n    \"Equivalent (e)\".\n            The inherent computational complexity (NP-hard) per iteration suggests\n    that a suitable value for the number of reactions is around 20.\n            Three functions comprise ReDirection.

    "description": "Performs Principal Components Analysis (also known as PCA) dimensionality reduction in the context of a linear regression. In most cases, PCA dimensionality reduction is performed independent of the response variable for a regression. This captures the majority of the variance of the model's predictors, but may not actually be the optimal dimensionality reduction solution for a regression against the response variable. An alternative method, optimized for a regression against the response variable, is to use both PCA and a relative importance measure. This package applies PCA to a given data frame of predictors, and then calculates the relative importance of each PCA factor against the response variable. It outputs ordered factors that are optimized for model fit. By performing dimensionality reduction with this method, an individual can achieve a the same r-squared value as performing just PCA, but with fewer PCA factors.

Seemingly, codon usage bias is affected by both selective constraints and mutation bias which allows and enables us to examine and detect changes in these two evolutionary forces between genomes or along one genome. Therefore, we determined the codon adaptation index (CAI), effective number of codons (ENC) and codon usage analysis with calculation of the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and subsequently predicted the translation efficiency and accuracy through GC-rich codon usages. Furthermore, we estimated the relative stability of the DNA sequence following calculation of the average free energy (Delta G) and Dimer base-stacking energy level.",

The Universal exPression Codes (UPC) method is an extension of SCAN that estimates whether a given gene/transcript is active above background levels in a given sample. The UPC method can be applied to one-channel or two-channel microarrays as well as to RNA-Seq read counts.

SCANVIS assesses each junction's relative read support (RRS) by relating to the context of local split reads aligning to annotated transcripts. SCANVIS also annotates each splice junction by indicating whether the junction is supported by annotation or not, and if not, what type of junction it is (e.g. exon skipping, alternative 5' or 3' events, Novel Exons). Unannotated junctions are also futher annotated by indicating whether it induces a frame shift or not. SCANVIS includes a visualization function to generate static sashimi-style plots depicting relative read support and number of split reads using arc thickness and arc heights, making it easy for users to spot well-supported junctions. These plots also clearly delineate unannotated junctions from annotated ones using designated color schemes, and users can also highlight splice junctions of choice. Variants and/or a read profile are also incoroporated into the plot if the user supplies variants in bed format and/or the BAM file. One further feature of the visualization function is that users can submit multiple samples of a certain disease or cohort to generate a single plot - this occurs via a \"merge\" function wherein junction details over multiple samples are merged to generate a single sashimi plot, which is useful when contrasting cohorots (eg. disease vs control).",

This circumvents the averaging effects associated with bulk-tissue sequencing and has increased resolution yet decreased ambiguity in deconvolving cancer subclones and elucidating cancer evolutionary history. ScDNA-seq data is, however, sparse, noisy, and highly variable even within a homogeneous cell population, due to the biases and artifacts that are introduced during the library preparation and sequencing procedure. Here, we propose SCOPE, a normalization and copy number estimation method for scDNA-seq data. The distinguishing features of SCOPE include: (i) utilization of cell-specific Gini coefficients for quality controls and for identification of normal/diploid cells, which are further used as negative control samples in a Poisson latent factor model for normalization; (ii) modeling of GC content bias using an expectation-maximization algorithm embedded in the Poisson generalized linear models, which accounts for the different copy number states along the genome; (iii) a cross-sample iterative segmentation procedure to identify breakpoints that are shared across cells from the same genetic background.",

    "description": "In various domains, many datasets exhibit both high variable dependency and group structures, which necessitates their simultaneous estimation. This package provides functions for two subgroup identification methods based on penalized functions, both of which utilize factor model structures to adapt to data with cross-sectional dependency. The first method is the Subgroup Identification with Latent Factor Structure Method (SILFSM) we proposed. By employing Center-Augmented Regularization and factor structures, the SILFSM effectively eliminates data dependencies while identifying subgroups within datasets. For this model, we offer optimization functions based on two different methods: Coordinate Descent and our newly developed Difference of Convex-Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DC-ADMM) algorithms; the latter can be applied to cases where the distance function in Center-Augmented Regularization takes L1 and L2 forms. The other method is the Factor-Adjusted Pairwise Fusion Penalty (FA-PFP) model, which incorporates factor augmentation into the Pairwise Fusion Penalty (PFP) developed by Ma, S. and Huang, J. (2017) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1148039>. Additionally, we provide a function for the Standard CAR (S-CAR) method, which does not consider the dependency and is for comparative analysis with other approaches. Furthermore, functions based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of the SILFSM and the FA-PFP method are also included in 'SILFS' for selecting tuning parameters. For more details of Subgroup Identification with Latent Factor Structure Method, please refer to He et al. (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2407.00882>. ",

    "description": "To date, thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be associated with complex traits and diseases. However, the vast majority of these disease-associated SNPs lie in the non-coding part of the genome, and are likely to affect regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, rather than function of a protein. Thus, to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic traits and diseases, it becomes increasingly important to study the effect of a SNP on nearby molecular traits such as chromatin environment or transcription factor (TF) binding. Towards this aim, we developed SNPhood, a user-friendly *Bioconductor* R package to investigate and visualize the local neighborhood of a set of SNPs of interest for NGS data such as chromatin marks or transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-Seq or RNA- Seq experiments. SNPhood comprises a set of easy-to-use functions to extract, normalize and summarize reads for a genomic region, perform various data quality checks, normalize read counts using additional input files, and to cluster and visualize the regions according to the binding pattern. The regions around each SNP can be binned in a user-defined fashion to allow for analysis of very broad patterns as well as a detailed investigation of specific binding shapes. Furthermore, SNPhood supports the integration with genotype information to investigate and visualize genotype-specific binding patterns. Finally, SNPhood can be employed for determining, investigating, and visualizing allele-specific binding patterns around the SNPs of interest.",

However, novel spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiling techniques lack single-cell resolution and require a combination with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) information to deconvolute the spatially indexed datasets. Leveraging the strengths of both data types, we developed SPOTlight, a computational tool that enables the integration of ST with scRNA-seq data to infer the location of cell types and states within a complex tissue. SPOTlight is centered around a seeded non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) regression, initialized using cell-type marker genes and non-negative least squares (NNLS) to subsequently deconvolute ST capture locations (spots).",

    "description": "Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an identical sample size. Rarefying (random subsampling without replacement), which is a popular method for normalization, has been widely criticized for its poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the community structure. In the context of microbiome count data, researchers explicitly advised against the use of rarefying. An alternative to rarefying is scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS). SRS consists of two steps. In the first step, the total counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or species in each sample are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts Cscaled equals Cmin. In the second step, the non-integer Cscaled values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The Cscaled value for each OTU or species is split into the integer part Cint  (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cints). Since the sum of Cint is smaller or equal to Cmin, additional  delta C = Cmin - the sum of Cint counts have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values. Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches delta C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking delta C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement.

More specifically, given a matrix of coordinates as input, SamSPECTRAL first builds the communities to sample the data points. Then, it builds a graph and after weighting the edges by conductance computation, the graph is passed to a classic spectral clustering algorithm to find the spectral clusters. The last stage of SamSPECTRAL is to combine the spectral clusters. The resulting \"connected components\" estimate biological cell populations in the data.

    "description": "RNA sequencing analysis methods are often derived by relying on hypothetical parametric models for read counts that are not likely to be precisely satisfied in practice. Methods are often tested by analyzing data that have been simulated according to the assumed model. This testing strategy can result in an overly optimistic view of the performance of an RNA-seq analysis method. We develop a data-based simulation algorithm for RNA-seq data. The vector of read counts simulated for a given experimental unit has a joint distribution that closely matches the distribution of a source RNA-seq dataset provided by the user. Users control the proportion of genes simulated to be differentially expressed (DE) and can provide a vector of weights to control the distribution of effect sizes. The algorithm requires a matrix of RNA-seq read counts with large sample sizes in at least two treatment groups. Many datasets are available that fit this standard.",

Moreover, it equips researchers with tools for performing essential placebo and balancing checks comprehensively. The fact that researchers do not have to rely on 'APIs' of external 'GIS' software ensures replicability and raises the standard for spatial RDDs.",

We introduce a novel visualization for AS using normalized coverage, thereby allowing visualization of differential AS across conditions. SpliceWiz features a shiny-based GUI facilitating interactive data exploration of results including gene ontology enrichment. It is performance optimized with multi-threaded processing of BAM files and a new COV file format for fast recall of sequencing coverage.

Unobserved values of either outcome are treated as missing data. In contrast to imputation-based inference, no assumptions are required regarding the relationship between the target and surrogate outcomes. Estimation in the presence of bilateral outcome missingness is performed via an expectation conditional maximization either algorithm. In the case of unilateral target missingness, estimation is performed using an accelerated least squares procedure. A flexible association test is provided for evaluating hypotheses about the target regression parameters.

This can be done by performing a multi-step normalization strategy (called DEGES for DEG elimination strategy). A major characteristic of TCC is to provide the robust normalization methods for several kinds of count data (two-group with or without replicates, multi-group/multi-factor, and so on) by virtue of the use of combinations of functions in depended packages.",

    "description": "The analysis of microarray time series promises a deeper insight into the dynamics of the cellular response following stimulation. A common observation in this type of data is that some genes respond with quick, transient dynamics, while other genes change their expression slowly over time. The existing methods for detecting significant expression dynamics often fail when the expression dynamics show a large heterogeneity. Moreover, these methods often cannot cope with irregular and sparse measurements. The method proposed here is specifically designed for the analysis of perturbation responses. It combines different scores to capture fast and transient dynamics as well as slow expression changes, and performs well in the presence of low replicate numbers and irregular sampling times. The results are given in the form of tables including links to figures showing the expression dynamics of the respective transcript. These allow to quickly recognise the relevance of detection, to identify possible false positives and to discriminate early and late changes in gene expression. An extension of the method allows the analysis of the expression dynamics of functional groups of genes, providing a quick overview of the cellular response. The performance of this package was tested on microarray data derived from lung cancer cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Paper: Albrecht, Marco, et al.

    "description": "The data that is generated from independent and consecutive 'GillespieSSA' runs for a generic biochemical network\n    is formatted as rows and constitutes an observation. The first column of each row is the computed timestep for each run. Subsequent \n    columns are used for the number of molecules of each participating molecular species or \"metabolite\" of a generic biochemical network. \n    In this way 'TemporalGSSA', is a wrapper for the R-package 'GillespieSSA'. The number of observations must be at least 30. \n    This will generate data that is statistically significant. 'TemporalGSSA', transforms this raw data into a simulation time-dependent and metabolite-specific\n    trial. Each such trial is defined as a set of linear models (n >= 30) between a timestep and number of molecules for a metabolite. Each linear model \n    is characterized by coefficients such as the slope, arbitrary constant, etc. The user must enter an integer from 1-4.\n    These specify the statistical modality utilized to compute a representative timestep (mean, median, random, all).\n    These arguments are mandatory and will be checked. Whilst, the numeric indicator \"0\" indicates suitability,\n    \"1\" prompts the user to revise and re-enter their data. An optional logical argument controls the output to the \n    console with the default being \"TRUE\" (curtailed) whilst \"FALSE\" (verbose). The coefficients of each linear model are averaged (mean slope, mean constant)\n    and are incorporated into a metabolite-specific linear regression model as the dependent variable. The independent variable is the representative timestep \n    chosen previously. The generated data is the imputed molecule number for an in silico experiment with (n >=30) \n    observations. These steps can be replicated with multiple set of observations. The generated \"technical \n    replicates\" can be statistically evaluated (mean, standard deviation) and will constitute simulation time-dependent molecules for each metabolite. \n    For SSA-generated datasets with varying simulation times 'TemporalGSSA' will generate a simulation time-dependent trajectory for each metabolite\n    of the biochemical network under study.

(i) For sampling at one time point, simulations are performed under a constant rate birth-death process, conditioned on having a fixed number of final tips (sim.bd.taxa()), or a fixed age (sim.bd.age()), or a fixed age and number of tips (sim.bd.taxa.age()). When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot(), LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa() is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa(). This function further allows to simulate under epidemiological models with an exposed class. The function sim.genespeciestree() simulates coalescent gene trees within birth-death species trees, and sim.genetree() simulates coalescent gene trees.",

Trees with a user-specified number of extant tips, or a user-specified stem age are simulated. It is possible to assume any probability distribution for the waiting time until speciation and extinction. Furthermore, the waiting times to speciation / extinction may be scaled in different parts of the tree, meaning we can simulate trees with clade-dependent diversification processes. At a speciation event, one species splits into two. We allow for two different modes at these splits: (i) symmetric, where for every speciation event new waiting times until speciation and extinction are drawn for both daughter lineages; and (ii) asymmetric, where a speciation event results in one species with new waiting times, and another that carries the extinction time and age of its ancestor. The symmetric mode can be seen as an vicariant or allopatric process where divided populations suffer equal evolutionary forces while the asymmetric mode could be seen as a peripatric speciation where a mother lineage continues to exist.

    "description": "The Upsilon test assesses association among\n categorical variables against the null hypothesis of\n independence (Luo 2021 MS thesis; ProQuest Publication\n No. 28649813). While promoting dominant function patterns,\n it demotes non-dominant function patterns. It is robust\n to low expected count---continuity correction\n like Yates's seems unnecessary. Using a common null\n population following a uniform distribution, contingency\n tables are comparable by statistical significance---not\n the case for most association tests defining a varying\n null population by tensor product of observed marginals.\n Although Pearson's chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test,\n and Woolf's G-test (related to mutual information) are\n useful in some contexts, the Upsilon test appeals to\n ranking association patterns not necessarily following\n same marginal distributions, such as in count data\n from DNA sequencing---an important modern scientific\n domain.",

    "description": "A fundamental problem in biomedical research is the low number of observations, mostly due to a lack of available biosamples, prohibitive costs, or ethical reasons. By augmenting a few real observations with artificially generated samples, their analysis could lead to more robust and higher reproducible. One possible solution to the problem is the use of generative models, which are statistical models of data that attempt to capture the entire probability distribution from the observations. Using the variational autoencoder (VAE), a well-known deep generative model, this package is aimed to generate samples with gene expression data, especially for single-cell RNA-seq data. Furthermore, the VAE can use conditioning to produce specific cell types or subpopulations. The conditional VAE (CVAE) allows us to create targeted samples rather than completely random ones.",

Using available R packages and novel developments, ViSEAGO extends classical functional GO analysis to focus on functional coherence by aggregating closely related biological themes while studying multiple datasets at once. It provides both a synthetic and detailed view using interactive functionalities respecting the GO graph structure and ensuring functional coherence supplied by semantic similarity.

ZV-CV is a parametric approach that is exact for (low order) polynomial integrands with Gaussian targets. CF is a non-parametric alternative that offers better than the standard Monte Carlo convergence rates. SECF has both a parametric and a non-parametric component and it offers the advantages of both for an additional computational cost. Functions for applying ZV-CV and CF to two estimators for the normalising constant of the posterior distribution in Bayesian statistics are also supplied in this package.

This information proves to be of particular use in the context of translational medicine. For example, in cancer genomes, the Zygosity-Predictor can address whether unmutated copies of tumor-suppressor genes are present. Beyond this, it is possible to make this statement for all genes of an organism. The Zygosity-Predictor was primarily developed to handle SNVs and INDELs (later addressed as small-variants) of somatic and germline origin. In order not to overlook severe effects outside of the small-variant context, it has been extended with the assessment of large scale deletions, which cause losses of whole genes or parts of them.",

    "description": "Determination of absolute protein quantities is necessary for multiple applications, such as mechanistic modeling of biological systems. Quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics can measure relative protein abundance on a system-wide scale. To estimate absolute quantitative information using these relative abundance measurements requires additional information such as heavy-labeled references of known concentration. Multiple methods have been using different references and strategies; some are easily available whereas others require more effort on the users end. Hence, we believe the field might benefit from making some of these methods available under an automated framework, which also facilitates validation of the chosen strategy. We have implemented the most commonly used absolute label-free protein abundance estimation methods for LC-MS/MS modes quantifying on either MS1-, MS2-levels or spectral counts together with validation algorithms to enable automated data analysis and error estimation. Specifically, we used Monte-carlo cross-validation and bootstrapping for model selection and imputation of proteome-wide absolute protein quantity estimation. Our open-source software is written in the statistical programming language R and validated and demonstrated on a synthetic sample. ",

The best combinations of quantiles can be chosen from a set of user-defined quantiles combinations by cross-validation. By doing this, it enables us to do the feature selection for different blocks, and the selected features can then be further used to predict the outcome. For example, in biomedical applications, clinical covariates plus different types of omics data such as microbiome, metabolome, mRNA data, methylation data, copy number variation data might be predictive for patients outcome such as survival time or response to therapy. Different types of data could be put in different blocks and along with survival time to fit the model. The fitted model can then be used to predict the survival for the new samples with the corresponding clinical covariates and omics data. In addition, Adaptive Sparse Multi-block Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis is also included, which extends Adaptive Sparse Multi-block Partial Least Square for classifying the categorical outcome.",

The acronym 'BGW' (from the \n   authors' last names) will be used when making reference to technical \n   content (e.g., algorithm, methodology) that originally appeared in ACM TOMS.\n   A key feature of BGW is that it exploits the special structure of statistical \n   estimation problems within a trust-region-based optimization approach to \n   produce an estimation algorithm that is much more effective than the usual \n   practice of using optimization methods and codes originally developed for \n   general optimization. The 'bgw' package bundles 'R' wrapper (and related) \n   functions with modified 'Fortran' source code so that it can be compiled and \n   linked in the 'R' environment for fast execution. This version implements \n   a function ('bgw_mle.R') that performs maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) \n   for a user-provided model object that computes probabilities (a.k.a. \n   probability densities). The original motivation for producing this package \n   was to provide fast, efficient, and reliable MLE for discrete choice models \n   that can be called from the 'Apollo' choice modelling 'R' package ( \n   see <http://www.apollochoicemodelling.com>). Starting with the release of \n   Apollo 3.0, BGW is the default estimation package. However, estimation can also \n   be performed using BGW in a stand-alone fashion without using 'Apollo' \n   (as shown in simple examples included in the package). Note also that BGW \n   capabilities are not limited to MLE, and future extension to other estimators \n   (e.g., nonlinear least squares, generalized method of moments, etc.) is possible. \n   The 'Fortran' code included in 'bgw' was modified by one of the \n   original BGW authors (Bunch) under his rights as confirmed by direct \n   consultation with the ACM Intellectual Property and Rights Manager.  See \n   <https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/author-rights>. The main \n   requirement is clear citation of the original publication (see above). ",

To harness the collective evidence of the crowd, \n    Ville Satopää (2021) \"Regularized Aggregation of One-off Probability Predictions\"\n    <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3769945> proposes a Bayesian\n    aggregator that is regularized by analyzing the forecasters' disagreement and ascribing \n    over-dispersion to noise. This aggregator requires no user intervention and can be computed\n    efficiently even for a large numbers of predictions. The author evaluates\n    the aggregator on subjective probability predictions collected during\n    a four-year forecasting tournament sponsored by the US intelligence community.\n    The aggregator improves the accuracy of simple averaging by around 20% and\n    other state-of-the-art aggregators by 10-25%. The advantage stems almost\n    exclusively from improved calibration. This aggregator -- know as \"the revealed\n    aggregator\" -- inputs a) forecasters' probability predictions (p) of a future binary event\n    and b) the forecasters' common prior (p0) of the future event. In this R-package,\n    the function sample_aggregator(p,p0,...) allows the user to calculate the revealed\n    aggregator. Its use is illustrated with a simple example. ",

    "description": "The Super Imposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) model \n    is a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed effect model that fits a natural cubic \n    spline mean curve to the growth data and aligns individual-specific growth \n    curves to the underlying mean curve via a set of random effects (see Cole, \n    2010 <doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115> for details). The non-Bayesian version of the \n    SITAR model can be fit by using the already available R package 'sitar'. While \n    the 'sitar' package allows modelling of a single outcome only, the 'bsitar' \n    package offers great flexibility in fitting models of varying complexities, \n    including joint modelling of multiple outcomes such as height and weight \n    (multivariate model). Additionally, the 'bsitar' package allows for the simultaneous  \n    analysis of an outcome separately for subgroups defined by a factor variable such \n    as gender. This is achieved by fitting separate models for each subgroup \n    (for example males and females for gender variable). An advantage of this approach \n    is that posterior draws for each subgroup are part of a single model object, \n    making it possible to compare coefficients across subgroups and test hypotheses. \n    Since the 'bsitar' package is a front-end to the R package 'brms', it offers excellent \n    support for post-processing of posterior draws via various functions that are \n    directly available from the 'brms' package. In addition, the 'bsitar' package \n    includes various customized functions that allow for the visualization of distance \n    (increase in size with age) and velocity (change in growth rate as a function of age), \n    as well as the estimation of growth spurt parameters such as age at peak growth velocity  \n    and peak growth velocity.",

Our read-based deconvolution algorithm exploits the pervasiveness of DNA methylation for signal enhancement, therefore can sensitively identify a trace amount of tumor-specific or tissue-specific cfDNA in plasma. cfTools provides functions for (1) cancer detection: sensitively detect tumor-derived cfDNA and estimate the tumor-derived cfDNA fraction (tumor burden); (2) tissue deconvolution: infer the tissue type composition and the cfDNA fraction of multiple tissue types for a plasma cfDNA sample. These functions can serve as foundations for more advanced cfDNA-based studies, including cancer diagnosis and disease monitoring.",

The best layout of the bi-graph is provided by the barycentre algorithm, which minimises the weighted number of crossings. In the case of comparing a hierarchical and a non-hierarchical clustering, the dendrogram is pruned at different heights, selected by exploring the tree by depth-first search, starting at the root. Branches are decided to be split according to the value of a scoring function, that can be based either on the aesthetics of the bi-graph or on the mutual information between the hierarchical and the flat clusterings. A mapping between groups of clusters from each side is constructed with a greedy algorithm, and can be additionally visualised.",

Each is given in greater detail next. \n  (1) Plots the two-dimensional confidence region for probability distribution parameters \n  (supported distribution suffixes: cauchy, gamma, invgauss, logis, llogis, lnorm, norm, unif, \n  weibull) corresponding to a user-given complete or right-censored dataset and level of \n  significance.  The crplot() algorithm plots more points in areas of greater curvature to \n  ensure a smooth appearance throughout the confidence region boundary.  An alternative \n  heuristic plots a specified number of points at roughly uniform intervals along its boundary. \n  Both heuristics build upon the radial profile log-likelihood ratio technique for plotting \n  confidence regions given by Jaeger (2016) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1182946>, and\n  are detailed in a publication by Weld et al.

(3) Calculates confidence interval bounds for a binomial proportion \n  with binomTest(), calculates the actual coverage with binomTestCoverage(), and plots the \n  actual coverage with binomTestCoveragePlot(). Calculates confidence interval bounds for the\n  binomial proportion using an ensemble of constituent confidence intervals with \n  binomTestEnsemble(). Calculates confidence interval bounds for the binomial proportion using \n  a complete enumeration of all possible transitions from one actual coverage acceptance curve \n  to another which minimizes the root mean square error for n <= 15 and follows the transitions \n  for well-known confidence intervals for n > 15 using binomTestMSE(). (4) The km.support() \n  function calculates the support values of the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator for a given \n  sample size n using an induction algorithm described in Qin et al. (2023) \n  <doi:10.1080/00031305.2022.2070279>. The km.outcomes() function generates a matrix \n  containing all possible outcomes (all possible sequences of failure times and right-censoring \n  times) of the value of the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator for a particular sample size \n  n. The km.pmf() function generates the probability mass function for the support values of \n  the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator for a particular sample size n, probability of \n  observing a failure h at the time of interest expressed as the cumulative probability \n  percentile associated with X = min(T, C), where T is the failure time and C is the censoring \n  time under a random-censoring scheme. The km.surv() function generates multiple probability \n  mass functions of the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator for the same arguments as those \n  given for km.pmf(). (5) The km.coverage() function plots the actual coverage function\n  associated with a confidence interval for the survivor function from a randomly right-censored\n  data set for one or more of the following confidence intervals: Greenwood, log-minus-log,\n  Peto, arcsine, and exponential Greenwood.  The actual coverage function is plotted for a\n  small number of items on test, stated coverage, failure rate, and censoring rate. The \n  km.coverage() function can print an optional table containing all possible\n  failure/censoring orderings, along with their contribution to the actual coverage function.",

The package also includes additional options, including variations of CA to address overdispersion in count data (e.g., Freeman-Tukey chi-squared residual), as well as the option to apply CA-style processing to continuous data (e.g., proteomic TOF intensities) with the Hellinger distance adaptation of CA.",

The quadratic exponential model \n             is suitable for the analysis of binary longitudinal data when state dependence (further \n             to the effect of the covariates and a time-fixed individual intercept) has to be taken \n             into account. Therefore, this is an alternative to the dynamic logit model having the \n             advantage of easily allowing conditional inference in order to eliminate the individual \n             intercepts and then getting consistent estimates of the parameters of main interest \n             (for the covariates and the lagged response). The simplified version of this model \n             does not distinguish, as the original model does, between the last time occasion \n             and the previous occasions. The modified version formulates in a different way the \n             interaction terms and it may be used to test in a easy way state dependence as shown \n             in Bartolucci, F., Nigro, V. & Pigini, C.

The non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques t-SNE and UMAP enable users to summarise complex high-dimensional sequencing data such as single cell RNAseq using lower dimensional representations. These lower dimensional representations enable the visualisation of discrete transcriptional states, as well as continuous trajectory (for example, in early development). However, these methods focus on the local neighbourhood structure of the data. In some cases, this results in misleading visualisations, where the density of cells in the low-dimensional embedding does not represent the transcriptional heterogeneity of data in the original high-dimensional space. den-SNE and densMAP aim to enable more accurate visual interpretation of high-dimensional datasets by producing lower-dimensional embeddings that accurately represent the heterogeneity of the original high-dimensional space, enabling the identification of homogeneous and heterogeneous cell states. This accuracy is accomplished by including in the optimisation process a term which considers the local density of points in the original high-dimensional space. This can help to create visualisations that are more representative of heterogeneity in the original high-dimensional space.",

    "description": "Models the relationship between dose levels and responses in a pharmacological experiment using the 4 Parameter Logistic model. Traditional packages on dose-response modelling such as 'drc' and 'nplr' often draw errors due to convergence failure especially when data have outliers or non-logistic shapes. This package provides robust estimation methods that are less affected by outliers and other initialization methods that work well for data lacking logistic shapes. We provide the bounds on the parameters of the 4PL model that prevent parameter estimates from diverging or converging to zero and base their justification in a statistical principle. These methods are used as remedies to convergence failure problems.  Gadagkar, S. R. and Call, G. B. (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.vascn.2014.08.006> Ritz, C. and Baty, F. and Streibig, J. C. and Gerhard, D.

Raw protein Unique Molecular Index (UMI) counts from sequencing DNA-conjugated antibody derived tags (ADT) in droplets (e.g. 'CITE-seq') have substantial measurement noise. Our experiments and computational modeling revealed two major components of this noise: 1) protein-specific noise originating from ambient, unbound antibody encapsulated in droplets that can be accurately inferred via the expected protein counts detected in empty droplets, and 2) droplet/cell-specific noise revealed via the shared variance component associated with isotype antibody controls and background protein counts in each cell. This package normalizes and removes both of these sources of noise from raw protein data derived from methods such as 'CITE-seq', 'REAP-seq', 'ASAP-seq', 'TEA-seq', 'proteogenomic' data from the Mission Bio platform, etc. See the vignette for tutorials on how to integrate dsb with 'Seurat' and 'Bioconductor' and how to use dsb in 'Python'.

As an example, the genetic predisposition for obesity could be manifested through inherited variants that control metabolism through regulation of genes expressed in the brain and/or through the control of fat storage in the adipose tissue by dysregulation of genes expressed in adipose tissue. We present a method eGST (eQTL-based genetic subtyper) that integrates tissue-specific eQTLs with GWAS data for a complex trait to probabilistically assign a tissue of interest to the phenotype of each individual in the study. eGST estimates the posterior probability that an individual's phenotype can be assigned to a tissue based on individual-level genotype data of tissue-specific eQTLs and marginal phenotype data in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) cohort. Under a Bayesian framework of mixture model, eGST employs a maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the tissue-specific posterior probability across individuals.

It also provides a bootstrap function to estimate the standard deviation of the estimated probabilities. In addition, it has functions that aggregate rows optimally to have more reliable estimates in cases of having few data points. For comparing the probability estimates of two groups, a Wald test routine is implemented. The library has data from the first round of the Chilean Presidential Election 2021 and can also generate synthetic election data.

The approach to FDR is described in the appendix of Moen et al. (2005) <doi:10.1128/AEM.71.4.2086-2094.2005>. Unbalanced designs are handled by Type II sums of squares as argued in Langsrud (2003) <doi:10.1023/A:1023260610025>. Furthermore, the Type II philosophy is extended to continuous design variables as described in Langsrud et al. (2007) <doi:10.1080/02664760701594246>. This means that the method is invariant to scale changes and that common pitfalls are avoided.",

    "description": "A typical gait analysis requires the examination of the motion of nine joint angles on the left-hand side and six joint angles on the right-hand side across multiple subjects. Due to the quantity and complexity of the data, it is useful to calculate the amount by which a subject’s gait deviates from an average normal profile and to represent this deviation as a single number. Such a measure can quantify the overall severity of a condition affecting walking, monitor progress, or evaluate the outcome of an intervention prescribed to improve the gait pattern. This R package provides tools for computing the Functional Gait Deviation Index, a novel index for quantifying gait pathology using multivariate functional principal component analysis. The package supports analysis at the level of both legs combined, individual legs, and individual joints/planes. It includes functions for functional data preprocessing, multivariate functional principal component decomposition, FGDI computation, and visualisation of gait abnormality scores. Further details can be found in Minhas, S. K., Sangeux, M., Polak, J., & Carey, M. (2025). The Functional Gait Deviation Index. Journal of Applied Statistics <doi:10.1080/02664763.2025.2514150>.",

A multi-stage screening approach is adopted for further acceleration. Besides the sparse linear model estimation, we also provide the extension of these Lasso variants to sparse Gaussian graphical model estimation including TIGER and CLIME using either L1 or adaptive penalty. Missing values can be tolerated for Dantzig selector and CLIME. The computation is memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output.

This package was originially developed for quantifying the function of gene regulatory networks in yeast (strain W303) expressing fluorescent reporter proteins using BD Accuri C6 and SORP cytometers. However, the functions are for the most part general and may be adapted for analysis of other organisms using other flow cytometers. Functions in this package facilitate the annotation of flow cytometry data with experimental metadata, as often required for publication and general ease-of-reuse. Functions for creating, saving and loading gate sets are also included. In the past, we have typically generated summary statistics for each flowset for each timepoint and then annotated and analyzed these summary statistics. This method loses a great deal of the power that comes from the large amounts of individual cell data generated in flow cytometry, by essentially collapsing this data into a bulk measurement after subsetting. In addition to these summary functions, this package also contains functions to facilitate annotation and analysis of steady-state or time-lapse data utilizing all of the data collected from the thousands of individual cells in each sample.",

    "description": "A tool to create hydroclimate scenarios, stress test systems and visualize system performance in scenario-neutral climate change impact assessments. Scenario-neutral approaches 'stress-test' the performance of a modelled system by applying a wide range of plausible hydroclimate conditions (see Brown & Wilby (2012) <doi:10.1029/2012EO410001> and Prudhomme et al. (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.06.043>). These approaches allow the identification of hydroclimatic variables that affect the vulnerability of a system to hydroclimate variation and change. This tool enables the generation of perturbed time series using a range of approaches including simple scaling of observed time series (e.g. Culley et al. (2016) <doi:10.1002/2015WR018253>) and stochastic simulation of perturbed time series via an inverse approach (see Guo et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.025>). It incorporates 'Richardson-type' weather generator model configurations documented in Richardson (1981) <doi:10.1029/WR017i001p00182>, Richardson and Wright (1984), as well as latent variable type model configurations documented in Bennett et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.12.043>, Rasmussen (2013) <doi:10.1002/wrcr.20164>, Bennett et al. (2019) <doi:10.5194/hess-23-4783-2019> to generate hydroclimate variables on a daily basis (e.g. precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration) and allows a variety of different hydroclimate variable properties, herein called attributes, to be perturbed. Options are included for the easy integration of existing system models both internally in R and externally for seamless 'stress-testing'. A suite of visualization options for the results of a scenario-neutral analysis (e.g. plotting performance spaces and overlaying climate projection information) are also included. Version 1.0 of this package is described in Bennett et al. (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.104999>. As further developments in scenario-neutral approaches occur the tool will be updated to incorporate these advances.",

The included functions are designed to: 1) calculate the fragility index (i.e., the minimal event status modifications that can alter the significance or non-significance of the original result) and fragility quotient (i.e., fragility index divided by sample size) at a specific significance level; 2) give the cases of event status modifications for altering the result's significance or non-significance and visualize these cases; 3) visualize the trend of statistical significance as event status is modified; 4) efficiently derive fragility indexes and fragility quotients at multiple significance levels, and visualize the relationship between these fragility measures against the significance levels; and 5) calculate fragility indexes and fragility quotients of multiple datasets (e.g., a collection of clinical trials or meta-analyses) and produce plots of their overall distributions.

All single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GWAS are placed in a 'circular genome' according to their location. Then the complete set of SNP association p-values are permuted by rotation with respect to the SNPs' genomic locations. Two testing frameworks are available: permutations at the gene level, and permutations at the SNP level. The permutation at the gene level uses Fisher's combination test to calculate a single gene p-value, followed by the hypergeometric test. The SNP count methodology maps each SNP to pathways/gene-sets and calculates the proportion of SNPs for the real and the permutated datasets above a pre-defined threshold. Genomicper requires a matrix of GWAS association p-values and SNPs annotation to genes. Pathways can be obtained from within the package or can be provided by the user.",

    "description": "Gene lists derived from the results of genomic analyses are rich in biological information. For instance, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from a microarray or RNA-Seq analysis are related functionally in terms of their response to a treatment or condition. Gene lists can vary in size, up to several thousand genes, depending on the robustness of the perturbations or how widely different the conditions are biologically. Having a way to associate biological relatedness between hundreds and thousands of genes systematically is impractical by manually curating the annotation and function of each gene. Over-representation analysis (ORA) of genes was developed to identify biological themes. Given a Gene Ontology (GO) and an annotation of genes that indicate the categories each one fits into, significance of the over-representation of the genes within the ontological categories is determined by a Fisher's exact test or modeling according to a hypergeometric distribution. Comparing a small number of enriched biological categories for a few samples is manageable using Venn diagrams or other means for assessing overlaps. However, with hundreds of enriched categories and many samples, the comparisons are laborious. Furthermore, if there are enriched categories that are shared between samples, trying to represent a common theme across them is highly subjective. goSTAG uses GO subtrees to tag and annotate genes within a set. goSTAG visualizes the similarities between the over-representation of DEGs by clustering the p-values from the enrichment statistical tests and labels clusters with the GO term that has the most paths to the root within the subtree generated from all the GO terms in the cluster.",

Multi-start optimization based on quasi-random samples is implemented using a modified version of the algorithm in Hickernell and Yuan (1997, OR Transactions). Robust nonlinear regression can be performed using various robust loss functions, in which case the optimization problem is solved by iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS). Bindings are provided to tune a number of parameters affecting the low-level aspects of the trust region algorithms. The interface mimics R's nls() function and returns model objects inheriting from the same class.",

It is more stringent than controlling the false discovery rate, and possesses theoretical robustness to positive correlations between tests and unequal weights. It is a multi-level test in the sense that a superset of one or more significant tests is certain to be significant and conversely when the superset is non-significant, the constituent tests are certain to be non-significant. It is based on MAMML (model averaging by mean maximum likelihood), a frequentist analogue to Bayesian model averaging, and is theoretically grounded in generalized central limit theorem.

    "description": "A two-step double-robust method to estimate the conditional average treatment effects (CATE) with potentially high-dimensional covariate(s). In the first stage, the nuisance functions necessary for identifying CATE are estimated by machine learning methods, allowing the number of covariates to be comparable to or larger than the sample size. The second stage consists of a low-dimensional local linear regression, reducing CATE to a function of the covariate(s) of interest. The CATE estimator implemented in this package not only allows for high-dimensional data, but also has the “double robustness” property: either the model for the propensity score or the models for the conditional means of the potential outcomes are allowed to be misspecified (but not both). This package is based on the paper by Fan et al., \"Estimation of Conditional Average Treatment Effects With High-Dimensional Data\" (2022), Journal of Business & Economic Statistics <doi:10.1080/07350015.2020.1811102>.",

Package 'hiphop' can deal with (a) the case where there \n  is contextual information about parentage of the mother (i.e. a female has been \n  seen to be involved in reproductive tasks such as nest building), but paternity \n  is unknown (e.g. due to promiscuity), (b) where both parents need to be assigned, \n  because there is no contextual information on which female laid eggs and which \n  male fertilized them (e.g. polygynandrous mating system where multiple females \n  and males deposit young in a common nest, or organisms with external fertilisation \n  that breed in aggregations).\n    For details: Cockburn, A., Penalba, J.V.,Jaccoud, D.,Kilian, A., Brouwer, L.,\n       Double, M.C., Margraf, N., Osmond, H.L., van de Pol, M. and Kruuk, L.E.B. \n       (in revision).

We believe individual-level expression patterns of pre-defined pathways or gene sets are better biomarkers than single genes. In this study, we devised a computational method named iPath to identify prognostic biomarker pathways, one sample at a time. To test its utility, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis across 14 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and demonstrated that iPath is capable of identifying highly predictive biomarkers for clinical outcomes, including overall survival, tumor subtypes, and tumor stage classifications. We found that pathway-based biomarkers are more robust and effective than single genes.",

    "description": "Interpreting the differences between mean scale scores across various\n    forms of an assessment can be challenging. This difficulty arises from different\n    mappings between raw scores and scale scores, complex mathematical relationships,\n    adjustments based on judgmental procedures, and diverse equating functions applied\n    to different assessment forms. An alternative method involves running simulations\n    to explore the effect of incrementing raw scores on mean scale scores. The\n    'idmact' package provides an implementation of this approach based on the\n    algorithm detailed in Schiel (1998)\n    <https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/ACT_RR98-01.pdf> which\n    was developed to help interpret differences between mean scale scores on the\n    American College Testing (ACT) assessment. The function idmact_subj() within\n    the package offers a framework for running simulations on subject-level scores.\n    In contrast, the idmact_comp() function provides a framework for conducting\n    simulations on composite scores.",

More than 28,000 different HLA alleles have been reported, with significant differences in allele frequencies between human populations worldwide. Reproducible and consistent annotation of HLA alleles in large-scale bioinformatics workflows remains challenging, because the available reference databases and software tools often use different HLA naming schemes. The package immunotation provides tools for consistent annotation of HLA genes in typical immunoinformatics workflows such as for example the prediction of MHC-presented peptides in different human donors. Converter functions that provide mappings between different HLA naming schemes are based on the MHC restriction ontology (MRO). The package also provides automated access to HLA alleles frequencies in worldwide human reference populations stored in the Allele Frequency Net Database.",

For example, in biomedical applications patient outcome such as survival time or response to therapy may have to be predicted based on, say, mRNA data, miRNA data, methylation data, CNV data, clinical data, etc. The clinical predictors are on average often much more important for outcome prediction than the mRNA data. The ipflasso method takes this problem into account by using different penalty parameters for predictors from different modalities.

The JEEK algorithm can be used to fast estimate multiple related precision matrices in a large-scale. For instance, it can identify multiple gene networks from multi-context gene expression datasets. By performing data-driven network inference from high-dimensional and heterogeneous data sets, this tool can help users effectively translate aggregated data into knowledge that take the form of graphs among entities.

Since most of the existing internal indices suggest a k value which is computed from the clustering results after several runs of a clustering algorithm they are computationally expensive. On the contrary,  the package 'kpeaks' enables to estimate k before running any clustering algorithm. It is based on a simple novel technique using the descriptive statistics of peak counts of the features in a data set.",

However, to fit the measurements of ~1000 genes in the ~500 color channels of LINCS L1000, every two landmark genes are designed to share a single channel. Thus, a deconvolution step is required to infer the expression values of each gene. Any errors in this step can be propagated adversely to the downstream analyses. We present a LINCS L1000 data peak calling R package l1kdeconv based on a new outlier detection method and an aggregate Gaussian mixture model. Upon the remove of outliers and the borrowing information among similar samples, l1kdeconv shows more stable and better performance than methods commonly used in LINCS L1000 data deconvolution.",

    "description": "We provide a solution for performing permutation tests on linear and mixed linear regression models. It\n             allows users to obtain accurate p-values without making distributional assumptions about the data. By \n             generating a null distribution of the test statistics through repeated permutations of the response variable,\n             permutation tests provide a powerful alternative to traditional parameter tests (Holt et al. (2023) \n             <doi:10.1007/s10683-023-09799-6>). In this early version, we focus on the permutation tests over observed \n             t values of beta coefficients, i.e.original t values generated by parameter tests. After generating a null \n             distribution of the test statistic through repeated permutations of the response variable, each observed t \n             values would be compared to the null distribution to generate a p-value. To improve the efficiency,a stop \n             criterion (Anscombe (1953) <doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1953.tb00121.x>) is adopted to force permutation to stop \n             if the estimated standard deviation of the value falls below a fraction of the estimated p-value. By doing so,\n             we avoid the need for massive calculations in exact permutation methods while still generating stable and accurate \n             p-values.",

    "description": "Mobile Motor Activity Research Consortium for Health (mMARCH) is a collaborative network of studies of clinical and community samples that employ common clinical, biological, and digital mobile measures across involved studies. One of the main scientific goals of mMARCH sites is developing a better understanding of the inter-relationships between accelerometry-measured physical activity (PA), sleep (SL), and circadian rhythmicity (CR) and mental and physical health in children, adolescents, and adults. Currently, there is no consensus on a standard procedure for a data processing pipeline of raw accelerometry data, and few open-source tools to facilitate their development. The R package 'GGIR' is the most prominent open-source software package that offers great functionality and tremendous user flexibility to process raw accelerometry data. However, even with 'GGIR', processing done in a harmonized and reproducible fashion requires a non-trivial amount of expertise combined with a careful implementation. In addition, novel accelerometry-derived features of PA/SL/CR capturing multiscale, time-series, functional, distributional and other complimentary aspects of accelerometry data being constantly proposed and become available via non-GGIR R implementations.  To address these issues, mMARCH developed a streamlined harmonized and reproducible pipeline for loading and cleaning raw accelerometry data, extracting features available through 'GGIR' as well as through non-GGIR R packages, implementing several data and feature quality checks, merging all features of PA/SL/CR together, and performing multiple analyses including Joint Individual Variation Explained (JIVE), an unsupervised machine learning dimension reduction technique that identifies latent factors capturing joint across and individual to each of three domains of PA/SL/CR.  In detail, the pipeline generates all necessary R/Rmd/shell files for data processing after running 'GGIR' for accelerometer data. In module 1, all csv files in the 'GGIR' output directory were read, transformed and then merged. In module 2, the 'GGIR' output files were checked and summarized in one excel sheet. In module 3, the merged data was cleaned according to the number of valid hours on each night and the number of valid days for each subject. In module 4, the cleaned activity data was imputed by the average Euclidean norm minus one (ENMO) over all the valid days for each subject. Finally, a comprehensive report of data processing was created using Rmarkdown, and the report includes few exploratory plots and multiple commonly used features extracted from minute level actigraphy data.

The package allows for direct inference with the specified model and prior. Using a hierarchical variance decomposition, we formulate a joint variance prior that takes the whole model structure into account. In this way, existing knowledge can intuitively be incorporated at the level it applies to. Alternatively, one can use independent variance priors for each model components in the latent Gaussian model.

    "description": "MapScape integrates clonal prevalence, clonal hierarchy, anatomic and mutational information to provide interactive visualization of spatial clonal evolution. There are four inputs to MapScape: (i) the clonal phylogeny, (ii) clonal prevalences, (iii) an image reference, which may be a medical image or drawing and (iv) pixel locations for each sample on the referenced image. Optionally, MapScape can accept a data table of mutations for each clone and their variant allele frequencies in each sample. The output of MapScape consists of a cropped anatomical image surrounded by two representations of each tumour sample. The first, a cellular aggregate, visually displays the prevalence of each clone. The second shows a skeleton of the clonal phylogeny while highlighting only those clones present in the sample. Together, these representations enable the analyst to visualize the distribution of clones throughout anatomic space.",

It takes a data.frame of omic data that contains at least two classes (control and test) and assigns a score to all samples based on how perturbed they are compared to the controls. It is based on the Molecular Distance to Health (Pankla et al. 2009), and expands on this algorithm by adding the options to calculate the z-score using the modified z-score (using median absolute deviation), change the z-score zeroing threshold, and look at genes that are most perturbed in the test versus control classes.",

However, comprehensive, genome-wide investigation of this relationship requires the evaluation of potentially millions of correlation values between the methylation of individual genomic loci and expression of associated transcripts in a relatively large numbers of samples. Methodical makes this process quick and easy while keeping a low memory footprint. It also provides a novel method for identifying regions where a number of methylation sites are consistently strongly associated with transcriptional expression. In addition, Methodical enables housing DNA methylation data from diverse sources (e.g. WGBS, RRBS and methylation arrays) with a common framework, lifting over DNA methylation data between different genome builds and creating base-resolution plots of the association between DNA methylation and transcriptional activity at transcriptional start sites.",

Linked micromap \n     plots are visualizations of geo-referenced data that link statistical \n     graphics to an organized series of small maps or graphic images. \n     The Help description contains examples of how to use the 'micromapST' \n     function. Contained in this package are border group datasets to \n     support creating linked micromap plots for the 50 U.S. states and \n     District of Columbia (51 areas), the U. S. 20 Seer Registries, the \n     105 counties in the state of Kansas, the 62 counties of New York, \n     the 24 counties of Maryland, the 29 counties of Utah, the 32 \n     administrative areas in China, the 218 administrative areas in \n     the UK and Ireland (for testing only), the 25 districts in the \n     city of Seoul South Korea, and the 52 counties on the Africa continent.\n     A border group dataset contains the boundaries related to the data \n     level areas, a second layer boundaries, a top or third layer boundary, \n     a parameter list of run options, and a cross indexing table between \n     area names, abbreviations, numeric identification and alias matching \n     strings for the specific geographic area.  By specifying a border group, \n     the package create linked micromap plots for any geographic region.  \n     The user can create and provide their own border group dataset for \n     any area beyond the areas contained within the package with the \n     'BuildBorderGroup' function. In April of 2022, it was announced that \n     'maptools', 'rgdal', and 'rgeos' R packages would be retired in \n     middle to end of 2023 and removed from the CRAN libraries.  \n     The 'BuildBorderGroup' function was dependent on these packages.  \n     'micromapST' functions were not impacted by the retired R packages.  \n     Upgrading of 'BuildBorderGroup' function was completed and released with \n     version 3.0.0 on August 10, 2023 using the 'sf' R package.\n     References: Carr and Pickle, Chapman and Hall/CRC, Visualizing\n     Data Patterns with Micromaps, CRC Press, 2010.

For 'LaTeX', we provide methods for the\n  Hmisc::latex() generic function to construct 'latex' tabular\n  environments which include the graphs.  These can be used directly\n  with the operating system 'pdflatex' or 'latex' command, or by using\n  one of 'Sweave', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', or 'Emacs org-mode' as an\n  intermediary.  For 'MS Word', the msWord() function uses the\n  'flextable' package to construct 'Word' tables which include the\n  graphs.  There are several distinct approaches for constructing HTML\n  files.  The simplest is to use the msWord() function with argument\n  filetype=\"html\".  Alternatively, use either 'Emacs org-mode' or the\n  htmlTable::htmlTable() function to construct an 'HTML' file\n  containing tables which include the graphs.  See the documentation\n  for our as.htmlimg() function.  For 'Excel' use on 'Windows', the\n  file examples/irisExcel.xls includes 'VBA' code which brings the\n  individual panels into individual cells in the spreadsheet.\n  Examples in the examples and demo subdirectories are shown with\n  'lattice' graphics, 'ggplot2' graphics, and 'base' graphics.\n  Examples for 'LaTeX' include 'Sweave' (both 'LaTeX'-style and\n  'Noweb'-style), 'knitr', 'emacs org-mode', and 'rmarkdown' input\n  files and their 'pdf' output files.  Examples for 'HTML' include\n  'org-mode' and 'Rmd' input files and their webarchive 'HTML' output\n  files.  In addition, the as.orgtable() function can display a\n  data.frame in an 'org-mode' document.  The examples for 'MS Word'\n  (with either filetype=\"docx\" or filetype=\"html\") work with all\n  operating systems.  The package does not require the installation of\n  'LaTeX' or 'MS Word' to be able to write '.tex' or '.docx' files.",

    "title": "Learning Causal or Non-Causal Graphical Models Using Information\nTheory",
    "description": "Multivariate Information-based Inductive Causation, better known \n    by its acronym MIIC, is a causal discovery method, based on information \n    theory principles, which learns a large class of causal or non-causal \n    graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects \n    of unobserved latent variables. Starting from a complete graph, the method \n    iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information \n    contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences \n    from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented \n    based on the signature of causality in observational data. The recent more \n    interpretable MIIC extension (iMIIC) further distinguishes genuine causes \n    from putative and latent causal effects, while scaling to very large \n    datasets (hundreds of thousands of samples). Since the version 2.0, MIIC \n    also includes a temporal mode (tMIIC) to learn temporal causal graphs from \n    stationary time series data. MIIC has been applied to a wide range of \n    biological and biomedical data, such as single cell gene expression data, \n    genomic alterations in tumors, live-cell time-lapse imaging data \n    (CausalXtract), as well as medical records of patients. MIIC brings unique \n    insights based on causal interpretation and could be used in a broad range \n    of other data science domains (technology, climatology, economy, ...). \n    For more information, you can refer to: \n    Simon et al., eLife 2024, <doi:10.1101/2024.02.06.579177>, \n    Ribeiro-Dantas et al., iScience 2024, <doi:10.1016/j.isci.2024.109736>, \n    Cabeli et al., NeurIPS 2021, <https://why21.causalai.net/papers/WHY21_24.pdf>, \n    Cabeli et al., Comput.

At present, analysis of taxonomic profiling data is mainly conducted using composition-based methods, which ignores interactions between community members. Besides this, a lack of efficient ways to compare microbial interaction networks limited the study of community dynamics. To better understand how community diversity is affected by complex interactions between its members, we developed a framework (Microbial community dIversity and Network Analysis, mina), a comprehensive framework for microbial community diversity analysis and network comparison. By defining and integrating network-derived community features, we greatly reduce noise-to-signal ratio for diversity analyses. A bootstrap and permutation-based method was implemented to assess community network dissimilarities and extract discriminative features in a statistically principled way.",

    "title": "Multiple-Inflated Negative Binomial Model",
    "description": "Count data is prevalent and informative, with widespread\n    application in many fields such as social psychology, personality, and\n    public health. Classical statistical methods for the analysis of count\n    outcomes are commonly variants of the log-linear model, including\n    Poisson regression and Negative Binomial regression. However, a\n    typical problem with count data modeling is inflation, in the sense\n    that the counts are evidently accumulated on some integers. Such an\n    inflation problem could distort the distribution of the observed\n    counts, further bias estimation and increase error, making the classic\n    methods infeasible. Traditional inflated value selection methods based\n    on histogram inspection are easy to neglect true points and\n    computationally expensive in addition. Therefore, we propose a\n    multiple-inflated negative binomial model to handle count data\n    modeling with multiple inflated values, achieving data-driven inflated\n    value selection. The proposed approach provides simultaneous\n    identification of important regression predictors on the target count\n    response as well.

    "description": "We introduce motifbreakR, which allows the biologist to judge in the first place whether the sequence surrounding the polymorphism is a good match, and in the second place how much information is gained or lost in one allele of the polymorphism relative to another. MotifbreakR is both flexible and extensible over previous offerings; giving a choice of algorithms for interrogation of genomes with motifs from public sources that users can choose from; these are 1) a weighted-sum probability matrix, 2) log-probabilities, and 3) weighted by relative entropy. MotifbreakR can predict effects for novel or previously described variants in public databases, making it suitable for tasks beyond the scope of its original design. Lastly, it can be used to interrogate any genome curated within Bioconductor (currently there are 32 species, a total of 109 versions).",

The main features of the packages include the utilization of higher-order background models and accounting for self-overlapping motif matches when determining motif enrichment. The background model allows to capture dinucleotide (or higher-order nucleotide) composition adequately which may reduced model biases and misleading results compared to using simple GC background models. When conducting a motif enrichment analysis based on the motif match count, the package relies on a compound Poisson distribution or alternatively a combinatorial model. These distribution account for self-overlapping motif structures as exemplified by repeat-like or palindromic motifs, and allow to determine the p-value and fold-enrichment for a set of observed motif matches.",

The simple calculation involves dividing the intensity of the selected precursor peak by the total intensity of the isolation window. When assessing MS/MS spectra this calculation is done before and after the MS/MS scan of interest and the purity is interpolated at the recorded time of the MS/MS acquisition. Additionally, isotopic peaks can be removed, low abundance peaks are removed that are thought to have limited contribution to the resulting MS/MS spectra and the isolation efficiency of the mass spectrometer can be used to normalise the intensities used for the calculation.",

This flexibility enables \n    researchers to tailor enrichment analysis to their specific questions, \n    such as identifying enriched transcriptional regulators in gene expression \n    data or overrepresented protein domains in protein sets. To facilitate \n    seamless analysis, mulea provides gene sets (in standardised GMT format) \n    for 27 model organisms, covering 22 ontology types from 16 databases and \n    various identifiers resulting in almost 900 files. Additionally, the \n    muleaData ExperimentData Bioconductor package simplifies access to these \n    pre-defined ontologies. Finally, mulea's architecture allows for easy \n    integration of user-defined ontologies, or GMT files from external \n    sources (e.g., MSigDB or Enrichr), expanding its applicability across \n    diverse research areas. Conclusions - mulea is distributed as a CRAN R \n    package. It offers researchers a powerful and flexible toolkit for \n    functional enrichment analysis, addressing limitations of traditional \n    tools with its progressive eFDR and by supporting a variety of ontologies. \n    Overall, mulea fosters the exploration of diverse biological questions \n    across various model organisms.",

Feature (gene) selection is a critical and an integral part of the process. Currently, there are many feature selection and clustering methods to identify the relevant genes and perform clustering of samples. However, choosing an appropriate methodology is difficult. In addition, extensive feature selection methods have not been supported by the available packages. Hence, we developed an integrative R-package called multiClust that allows researchers to experiment with the choice of combination of methods for gene selection and clustering with ease. Using multiClust, we identified the best performing clustering methodology in the context of clinical outcome. Our observations demonstrate that simple methods such as variance-based ranking perform well on the majority of data sets, provided that the appropriate number of genes is selected. However, different gene ranking and selection methods remain relevant as no methodology works for all studies.",

    "title": "Multivariate Genome Wide Marginal Epistasis Test",
    "description": "Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between genetic\n  loci, is known to play an important role in the phenotypic variation of\n  complex traits. As a result, many statistical methods have been developed to\n  identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis, and nearly all of\n  these approaches carry out this task by focusing on analyzing one trait at a\n  time. Previous studies have shown that jointly modeling multiple phenotypes\n  can often dramatically increase statistical power for association mapping. In\n  this  package, we present the 'multivariate MArginal ePIstasis Test'\n  ('mvMAPIT') – a multi-outcome generalization of a recently proposed epistatic\n  detection method which seeks to detect marginal epistasis or the combined\n  pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants.\n  By searching for marginal epistatic effects, one can identify genetic variants\n  that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact\n  partners with which the variants interact – thus, potentially alleviating\n  much of the statistical and computational burden associated with conventional\n  explicit search based methods. Our proposed 'mvMAPIT' builds upon this\n  strategy by taking advantage of correlation structure between traits to\n  improve the identification of variants involved in epistasis.\n  We formulate 'mvMAPIT' as a  multivariate linear mixed model and develop a\n  multi-trait variance component estimation algorithm for efficient parameter\n  inference and P-value computation. Together with reasonable model\n  approximations, our proposed approach is scalable to moderately sized\n  genome-wide association studies.\n  Crawford et al.

    "description": "We implement functions allowing for mediation analysis to be performed in cases where the mediator is a count variable with excess zeroes. First a function is provided allowing users to perform analysis for zero-inflated count variables using the marginalized zero-inflated Poisson (MZIP) model (Long et al. 2014 <DOI:10.1002/sim.6293>). Using the counterfactual approach to mediation and MZIP we can obtain natural direct and indirect effects for the overall population. Using delta method processes variance estimation can be performed instantaneously. Alternatively, bootstrap standard errors can be used. We also provide functions for cases with exposure-mediator interactions with four-way decomposition of total effect.",

    "description": "In empirical studies, instrumental variable (IV) regression is the signature method to solve the endogeneity problem. If we enforce the exogeneity condition of the IV, it is likely that we end up with a large set of IVs without knowing which ones are good. Also, one could face the model uncertainty for structural equation, as large micro dataset is commonly available nowadays. This package uses adaptive group lasso and B-spline methods to select the nonparametric components of the IV function, with the linear function being a special case (naivereg). The package also incorporates two stage least squares estimator (2SLS), generalized method of moment (GMM), generalized empirical likelihood (GEL) methods post instrument selection, logistic-regression instrumental variables estimator (LIVE, for dummy endogenous variable problem), double-selection plus instrumental variable estimator (DS-IV) and double selection plus logistic regression instrumental variable estimator (DS-LIVE), where the double selection methods are useful for high-dimensional structural equation models. The naivereg is nonparametric version of 'ivregress' in 'Stata' with IV selection and high dimensional features. The package is based on the paper by Q. Fan and W. Zhong, \"Nonparametric Additive Instrumental Variable Estimator: A Group Shrinkage Estimation Perspective\" (2018), Journal of Business & Economic Statistics <doi:10.1080/07350015.2016.1180991> as well as a series of working papers led by the same authors.

However, due to utilization of short reads, it is not well suited for identification of structural variants (SV). Optical mapping (OM) from Bionano Genomics, utilizes long fluorescently labeled megabase size DNA molecules for de novo genome assembly and identification of SVs with a much higher sensitivity than WGS. Nevertheless, currently available SV annotation tools have limited number of functions. NanotatoR is an R package written to provide a set of annotations for SVs identified by OM. It uses Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources (DECIPHER) as well as a subset (154 samples) of 1000 Genome Project to calculate the population frequencies of the SVs (an optional internal cohort SV frequency calculation is also available). NanotatoR creates a primary gene list (PG) from NCBI databases based on proband’s phenotype specific keywords and compares the list to the set of genes overlapping/near SVs. The output is given in an Excel file format, which is subdivided into multiple sheets based on SV type (e.g., INDELs, Inversions, Translocations). Users then have a choice to filter SVs using the provided annotations for de novo (if parental samples are available) or inherited rare variants.",

    "description": "In shotgun proteomics, shared peptides (i.e., peptides that might \n    originate from different proteins sharing homology, from different \n    proteoforms due to alternative mRNA splicing, post-translational \n    modifications, proteolytic cleavages, and/or allelic variants) represent a\n    major source of ambiguity in protein identifications. The 'net4pg' package \n    allows to assess and handle ambiguity of protein identifications. It \n    implements methods for two main applications. First, it allows to represent\n    and quantify ambiguity of protein identifications by means of graph \n    connected components (CCs). In graph theory, CCs are defined as the largest\n    subgraphs in which any two vertices are connected to each other by a path \n    and not connected to any other of the vertices in the supergraph. Here, \n    proteins sharing one or more peptides are thus gathered in the same CC \n    (multi-protein CC), while unambiguous protein identifications constitute CCs \n    with a single protein vertex (single-protein CCs). Therefore, the proportion\n    of single-protein CCs and the size of multi-protein CCs can be used to\n    measure the level of ambiguity of protein identifications. The package\n    implements a strategy to efficiently calculate graph connected\n    components on large datasets and allows to visually inspect them.\n    Secondly, the 'net4pg' package allows to exploit the increasing\n    availability of matched transcriptomic and proteomic datasets to\n    reduce ambiguity of protein identifications. More precisely, it\n    implement a transcriptome-based filtering strategy fundamentally\n    consisting in the removal of those proteins whose corresponding\n    transcript is not expressed in the sample-matched transcriptome. The\n    underlying assumption is that, according to the central dogma of\n    biology, there can be no proteins without the corresponding\n    transcript. Most importantly, the package allows to visually inspect\n    the effect of the filtering on protein identifications and quantify\n    ambiguity before and after filtering by means of graph connected\n    components. As such, it constitutes a reproducible and transparent\n    method to exploit transcriptome information to enhance protein\n    identifications. All methods implemented in the 'net4pg' package are fully \n    described in Fancello and Burger (2022) <doi:10.1186/s13059-022-02701-2>.",

Currently, the package has 3 methods for network inference including PANDA and its optimized implementation OTTER (network reconstruction using mutliple lines of biological evidence), LIONESS (single-sample network inference), and EGRET (genotype-specific networks). Network analysis methods include CONDOR (community detection), ALPACA (differential community detection), CRANE (significance estimation of differential modules), MONSTER (estimation of network transition states). In addition, YARN allows to process gene expresssion data for tissue-specific analyses and SAMBAR infers missing mutation data based on pathway information.",

It is a new multi-level approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach. At the first level, the method captures the global properties of the network, such as a scale-free structure and clustering coefficients, whereas the second level is targeted to capture local properties, including the probability of each couple of genes being linked. Up to now, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithms have been scarcely used in that setting and, due to the computational overhead, their application was limited to a small number of genes. On the contrary, our algorithm was made to cope with that issue and has low computational cost. It can be used, for instance, for elucidating gene regulatory network, which is an important step towards understanding the normal cell physiology and complex pathological phenotype. Reverse-engineering consists in using gene expressions over time or over different experimental conditions to discover the structure of the gene network in a targeted cellular process. The fact that gene expression data are usually noisy, highly correlated, and have high dimensionality explains the need for specific statistical methods to reverse engineer the underlying network. ",

However, selecting the numerous parameters of an exploratory clustering analysis in RNA profiling studies requires deep understanding of machine learning and extensive computational experimentation. Tools that assist with such decisions without prior field knowledge are nonexistent and further gene association analyses need to be performed independently. We have developed a suite of tools to automate these processes and make robust unsupervised clustering of transcriptomic data more accessible through automated machine learning based functions. The efficiency of each tool was tested with four datasets characterised by different expression signal strengths. Our toolkit’s decisions reflected the real number of stable partitions in datasets where the subgroups are discernible. Even in datasets with less clear biological distinctions, stable subgroups with different expression profiles and clinical associations were found.",

    "description": "omicsViewer visualizes ExpressionSet (or SummarizedExperiment) in an interactive way. The omicsViewer has a separate back- and front-end. In the back-end, users need to prepare an ExpressionSet that contains all the necessary information for the downstream data interpretation. Some extra requirements on the headers of phenotype data or feature data are imposed so that the provided information can be clearly recognized by the front-end, at the same time, keep a minimum modification on the existing ExpressionSet object. The pure dependency on R/Bioconductor guarantees maximum flexibility in the statistical analysis in the back-end. Once the ExpressionSet is prepared, it can be visualized using the front-end, implemented by shiny and plotly. Both features and samples could be selected from (data) tables or graphs (scatter plot/heatmap). Different types of analyses, such as enrichment analysis (using Bioconductor package fgsea or fisher's exact test) and STRING network analysis, will be performed on the fly and the results are visualized simultaneously. When a subset of samples and a phenotype variable is selected, a significance test on means (t-test or ranked based test; when phenotype variable is quantitative) or test of independence (chi-square or fisher’s exact test; when phenotype data is categorical) will be performed to test the association between the phenotype of interest with the selected samples. Additionally, other analyses can be easily added as extra shiny modules. Therefore, omicsViewer will greatly facilitate data exploration, many different hypotheses can be explored in a short time without the need for knowledge of R. In addition, the resulting data could be easily shared using a shiny server. Otherwise, a standalone version of omicsViewer together with designated omics data could be easily created by integrating it with portable R, which can be shared with collaborators or submitted as supplementary data together with a manuscript.",

After having constructed an OF prediction rule using a training dataset, \n  it can be used to predict the values of the ordinal target variable for new observations.\n  Moreover, by means of the (permutation-based) variable importance measure of OF, it is also\n  possible to rank the covariates with respect to their importance in the prediction of the \n  values of the ordinal target variable.\n  OF is presented in Hornung (2020).\n  NOTE: Starting with package version 2.4, it is also possible to obtain class probability \n  predictions in addition to the class point predictions. Moreover, the variable importance values\n  can also be based on the class probability predictions. Preliminary results indicate that\n  this might lead to a better discrimination between influential and non-influential covariates.\n  The main functions of the package are: ordfor() (construction of OF) and predict.ordfor() \n  (prediction of the target variable values of new observations).\n  References:\n  Hornung R.

For ease of use, the 'parDist' function\n    extends the signature of the 'dist' function and uses the same parameter\n    naming conventions as distance methods of existing R packages. The package\n    is mainly implemented in C++ and leverages the 'RcppParallel' package to\n    parallelize the distance computations with the help of the 'TinyThread'\n    library. Furthermore, the 'Armadillo' linear algebra library is used for\n    optimized matrix operations during distance calculations. The curiously\n    recurring template pattern (CRTP) technique is applied to avoid virtual\n    functions, which improves the Dynamic Time Warping calculations while\n    the implementation stays flexible enough to support different DTW step\n    patterns and normalization methods.",

Recent Bayesian Markov chain Monto Carlo (MCMC) methods have been developed for big data sets that are too large to be analyzed using traditional statistical methods. These methods partition the data into non-overlapping subsets, and perform parallel independent Bayesian MCMC analyses on the data subsets, creating independent subposterior samples for each data subset. These independent subposterior samples are combined through four functions in this package, including averaging across subset samples, weighted averaging across subsets samples, and kernel smoothing across subset samples. The four functions assume the user has previously run the Bayesian analysis and has produced the independent subposterior samples outside of the package; the functions use as input the array of subposterior samples. The methods have been demonstrated to be useful for Bayesian MCMC models including Bayesian logistic regression, Bayesian Gaussian mixture models and Bayesian hierarchical Poisson-Gamma models. The methods are appropriate for Bayesian hierarchical models with hyperparameters, as long as data values in a single level of the hierarchy are not split into subsets.",

Pairs are concordant when a participant who has a larger value on a variable than another participant also has a larger value on a second variable. The OPCP is therefore an easily interpretable indicator of monotonicity. The pervasive functions are essentially wrappers for the 'arules' package by Hahsler et al.

    "description": "Provides functions for modeling, comparing, and visualizing photosynthetic light response curves using established mechanistic and empirical models like the rectangular hyperbola Michaelis-Menton based models ((eq1 (Baly (1935) <doi:10.1098/rspb.1935.0026>)) (eq2 (Kaipiainenn (2009) <doi:10.1134/S1021443709040025>)) (eq3 (Smith (1936) <doi:10.1073/pnas.22.8.504>))), hyperbolic tangent based models ((eq4 (Jassby & Platt (1976) <doi:10.4319/LO.1976.21.4.0540>)) (eq5 (Abe et al. (2009) <doi:10.1111/j.1444-2906.2008.01619.x>))), the non-rectangular hyperbola model (eq6 (Prioul & Chartier (1977) <doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a085354>)), exponential based models ((eq8 (Webb et al. (1974) <doi:10.1007/BF00345747>)), (eq9 (Prado & de Moraes (1997) <doi:10.1007/BF02982542>))), and finally the Ye model (eq11 (Ye (2007) <doi:10.1007/s11099-007-0110-5>)). Each of these nonlinear least squares models are commonly used to express photosynthetic response under changing light conditions and has been well supported in the literature, but distinctions in each mathematical model represent moderately different assumptions about physiology and trait relationships which ultimately produce different calculated functional trait values. These models were all thoughtfully discussed and curated by Lobo et al. (2013) <doi:10.1007/s11099-013-0045-y> to express the importance of selecting an appropriate model for analysis, and methods were established in Davis et al. (in review) to evaluate the impact of analytical choice in phylogenetic analysis of the function-valued traits. Gas exchange data on 28 wild sunflower species from Davis et al.are included as an example data set here. ",

Lastly, numerous functions are designed for reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating, and manipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative data. For instance, there are functions for computing consensus phylogenies from a set, for simulating phylogenetic trees and data under a range of models, for randomly or non-randomly attaching species or clades to a tree, as well as for a wide range of other manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic biologists might find useful in their research.",

The package includes classes for encapsulating and generating model parameters, and managing the POM workflow. The workflow includes: model setup; generating model parameters via Latin hyper-cube sampling (Iman & Conover, 1980, <doi:10.1080/03610928008827996>); running multiple sampled model simulations; collating summary results; and validating and selecting an ensemble of models that best match known patterns. By default, model validation and selection utilizes an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach (Beaumont et al., 2002, <doi:10.1093/genetics/162.4.2025>), although alternative user-defined functionality could be employed. The package includes a spatially explicit demographic population model simulation engine, which incorporates default functionality for density dependence, correlated environmental stochasticity, stage-based transitions, and distance-based dispersal. The user may customize the simulator by defining functionality for translocations, harvesting, mortality, and other processes, as well as defining the sequence order for the simulator processes. The framework could also be adapted for use with other model simulators by utilizing its extendable (inheritable) base classes.",

Power analysis is in the context of estimating the LATE (also known as the complier average causal effect, or CACE), with calculations based on a test of the null hypothesis that the LATE equals 0 with a two-sided alternative. The method uses standardized effect sizes to place a conservative bound on the power under minimal assumptions. Package allows users to recover power, sample size requirements, or minimum detectable effect sizes. Package also allows users to work with absolute effects rather than effect sizes, to specify an additional assumption to narrow the bounds, and to incorporate covariate adjustment.",

    "description": "In a typical protein labelling procedure, proteins are chemically tagged with a functional group, usually at specific sites, then digested into peptides, which are then analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to generate peptide fingerprint. Relative to the control, peptides that are heavier by the mass of the labelling group are informative for sequence determination. Searching for peptides with such mass shifts, however, can be difficult. This package, designed to tackle this inconvenience, takes as input the mass list of two or multiple MALDI-TOF MS mass lists, and makes pairwise comparisons between the labeled groups vs. control, and restores centroid mass spectra with highlighted peaks of interest for easier visual examination. Particularly, peaks differentiated by the mass of the labelling group are defined as a “pair”, those with equal masses as a “match”, and all the other peaks as a “mismatch”.For more bioanalytical background information, refer to following publications: Jingjing Deng (2015) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2550-6_19>; Elizabeth Chang (2016) <doi:10.7171/jbt.16-2702-002>.",

    "description": "Hybrid control design is a way to borrow information from external controls to augment concurrent controls in a randomized controlled trial and is expected to overcome the feasibility issue when adequate randomized controlled trials cannot be conducted. A major challenge in the hybrid control design is its inability to eliminate a prior-data conflict caused by systematic imbalances in measured or unmeasured confounding factors between patients in the concurrent treatment/control group and external controls. To prevent the prior-data conflict, a combined use of propensity score matching and Bayesian commensurate prior has been proposed in the context of hybrid control design. The propensity score matching is first performed to guarantee the balance in baseline characteristics, and then the Bayesian commensurate prior is constructed while discounting the information based on the similarity in outcomes between the concurrent and external controls. 'psBayesborrow' is a package to implement the propensity score matching and the Bayesian analysis with commensurate prior, as well as to conduct a simulation study to assess operating characteristics of the hybrid control design, where users can choose design parameters in flexible and straightforward ways depending on their own application.",

This method is an extension of the p-uniform \n    method that allows for estimation of the average effect size and the \n    between-study variance in a meta-analysis, and uses both the statistically \n    significant and nonsignificant effect sizes. The third method in the package \n    is the hybrid method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2018) \n    <doi:10.3758/s13428-017-0967-6>. The hybrid method is a meta-analysis method \n    for combining a conventional study and replication/preregistered study while \n    taking into account statistical significance of the conventional study. This\n    method was extended in van Aert (2025) <doi:10.1037/met0000719> \n    such that it allows for the inclusion of multiple conventional and \n    replication/preregistered studies. The p-uniform and hybrid method are based \n    on the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is uniform \n    conditional on the population effect size. The fourth method in the package \n    is the Snapshot Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method as described in van Aert \n    and van Assen (2018) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0175302>. This method computes \n    posterior probabilities for four true effect sizes (no, small, medium, and \n    large) based on an original study and replication while taking into account \n    publication bias in the original study. The method can also be used for \n    computing the required sample size of the replication akin to power analysis \n    in null-hypothesis significance testing. The meta-plot is a visual tool for \n    meta-analysis that provides information on the primary studies in the \n    meta-analysis, the results of the meta-analysis, and characteristics of the \n    research on the effect under study (van Assen et al., 2023). Helper functions \n    to apply the Correcting for Outcome Reporting Bias (CORB) method to correct \n    for outcome reporting bias in a meta-analysis (van Aert & Wicherts, 2023).",

This is a novel Gene Set Enrichment-type test, which is designed to provide a faster, more accurate, and easier to understand test for gene expression studies. qusage accounts for inter-gene correlations using the Variance Inflation Factor technique proposed by Wu et al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2012). In addition, rather than simply evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a single number (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a complete probability density function (PDF). From this PDF, P values and confidence intervals can be easily extracted. Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc analysis (e.g., pair-wise comparisons of gene set activity) while maintaining statistical traceability. Finally, while qusage is compatible with individual gene statistics from existing methods (e.g., LIMMA), a Welch-based method is implemented that is shown to improve specificity. The QuSAGE package also includes a mixed effects model implementation, as described in (Turner JA et al, BMC Bioinformatics, 2015), and a meta-analysis framework as described in (Meng H, et al. PLoS Comput Biol. 2019). For questions, contact Chris Bolen (cbolen1@gmail.com) or Steven Kleinstein (steven.kleinstein@yale.edu)",

We showcase the functionalities of the (r)KOMICS tool suite using a whole-genome sequencing dataset from a recently published study on the history of diversification of the Leishmania braziliensis species complex in Peru. Analyses of population diversity and structure highlighted differences in minicircle sequence richness and composition between Leishmania subspecies, and between subpopulations within subspecies. The rKOMICS package establishes a critical framework to manipulate, explore and extract biologically relevant information from mitochondrial minicircle assemblies in tens to hundreds of samples simultaneously and efficiently.

Last but not least, package 'rPBK' can also be used for\n    dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA) to deal with metabolic networks. See also\n    Charles et al.

The test allows the comparison of \n    different solutions through a reference by first performing a rank \n    transformation on the input, then calculating and comparing the distances \n    between the solutions and the reference - the latter is measured in the \n    L1 norm. The reference can be an external benchmark (e.g. an established \n    gold standard) or can be aggregated from the data. The calculated distances, \n    called SRD scores, are validated in two ways, see Héberger and Kollár-Hunek \n    (2011) <doi:10.1002/cem.1320>. A randomization test (also called permutation \n    test) compares the SRD scores of the solutions to the SRD scores of randomly \n    generated rankings. The second validation option is cross-validation that \n    checks whether the rankings generated from the solutions come from the same \n    distribution or not. For a detailed analysis about the cross-validation \n    process see Sziklai, Baranyi and Héberger (2021) \n    <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2105.11939>. The package offers a wide array of \n    features related to SRD including the computation of the SRD scores, \n    validation options, input preprocessing and plotting tools. ",

The complete \n            iterative algorithm comprises of two steps. In the first step, the \n            network is expressed in terms of its leading eigenvalue and \n            eigenvector and recursively partition into two communities. \n            Partitioning occurs if the maximum positive \n            eigenvalue is greater than the tolerance (10e-5) for the current \n            partition, and if it results in a positive contribution to the \n            Modularity.\n            Given an initial separation using the leading eigen step, 'rSpectral' \n            then continues to maximise for the change in Modularity using a \n            fine-tuning step - or variate thereof. The first stage here is to \n            find the node which, when moved from one community to another, \n            gives the maximum change in Modularity.

Instead of moving each node \n            into each community in turn, we only consider moves of neighbouring \n            nodes, found in different communities, to the community of the \n            current node of interest. The two steps process is repeatedly \n            applied to each new community found, subdivided each community \n            into two new communities, until we are unable to find any division \n            that results in a positive change in Modularity.

In the same study, Tu & Zhou discuss that it can be difficult to control type-I error rates of general-purpose statistical tests for comparing the means of these particular data sets. This package allows users to perform a modified bootstrap-based t-test that aims to better control type-I error rates in these situations.",

'revtools' provides interfaces for each of these tasks. An alternative approach, however, is to draw on tools from machine learning to visualise patterns in the corpus.

The Barker\n    proposal, described in Livingstone and Zanella (2022)\n    <doi:10.1111/rssb.12482>, is a gradient-based MCMC algorithm inspired by the\n    Barker accept-reject rule. It combines the robustness of simpler MCMC\n    schemes, such as random-walk Metropolis, with the efficiency of\n    gradient-based methods, such as the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm. \n    The key function provided by the package is sample_chain(), which allows\n    sampling a Markov chain with a specified target distribution as its\n    stationary distribution. The chain is sampled by generating proposals and\n    accepting or rejecting them using a Metropolis-Hasting acceptance rule.\n    During an initial warm-up stage, the parameters of the proposal distribution\n    can be adapted, with adapters available to both: tune the scale of the\n    proposals by coercing the average acceptance rate to a target value; tune\n    the shape of the proposals to match covariance estimates under the target \n    distribution. As well as the default Barker proposal, the package also\n    provides implementations of alternative proposal distributions, such as\n    (Gaussian) random walk and Langevin proposals. Optionally, if 'BridgeStan's\n    R interface <https://roualdes.us/bridgestan/latest/languages/r.html>,\n    available on GitHub <https://github.com/roualdes/bridgestan>, is installed,\n    then 'BridgeStan' can be used to specify the target distribution to sample\n    from.",

    "description": "A common bioinformatics task in single-cell data analysis is to purify a cell type or cell population of interest from heterogeneous datasets. 'scGate' automatizes marker-based purification of specific cell populations, without requiring training data or reference gene expression profiles. Briefly, 'scGate' takes as input: i) a gene expression matrix stored in a 'Seurat' object and ii) a “gating model” (GM), consisting of a set of marker genes that define the cell population of interest. The GM can be as simple as a single marker gene, or a combination of positive and negative markers. More complex GMs can be constructed in a hierarchical fashion, akin to gating strategies employed in flow cytometry. 'scGate' evaluates the strength of signature marker expression in each cell using the rank-based method 'UCell', and then performs k-nearest neighbor (kNN) smoothing by calculating the mean 'UCell' score across neighboring cells. kNN-smoothing aims at compensating for the large degree of sparsity in scRNA-seq data. Finally, a universal threshold over kNN-smoothed signature scores is applied in binary decision trees generated from the user-provided gating model, to annotate cells as either “pure” or “impure”, with respect to the cell population of interest.

The function \"scMappR_and_pathway_analysis\" reranks DEGs to generate cell-type specificity scores called cell-weighted fold-changes. Users input a list of DEGs, normalized counts, and a signature matrix into this function. scMappR then re-weights bulk DEGs by cell-type specific expression from the signature matrix, cell-type proportions from RNA-seq deconvolution and the ratio of cell-type proportions between the two conditions to account for changes in cell-type proportion. With cwFold-changes calculated, scMappR uses two approaches to utilize cwFold-changes to complete cell-type specific pathway analysis. The \"process_dgTMatrix_lists\" function in the scMappR package contains an automated scRNA-seq processing pipeline where users input scRNA-seq count data, which is made compatible for scMappR and other R packages that analyze scRNA-seq data. We further used this to store hundreds up regularly updating signature matrices. The functions \"tissue_by_celltype_enrichment\", \"tissue_scMappR_internal\", and \"tissue_scMappR_custom\" combine these consistently processed scRNAseq count data with gene-set enrichment tools to allow for cell-type marker enrichment of a generic gene list (e.g. GWAS hits).

    "description": "We present a novel statistical framework for identifying differential distributions in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data between treatment conditions by modeling gene expression read counts using generalized linear models (GLMs). We model each gene independently under each treatment condition using error distributions Poisson (P), Negative Binomial (NB), Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) with log link function and model based normalization for differences in sequencing depth. Since all four distributions considered in our framework belong to the same family of distributions, we first perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to select genes belonging to the family of ZINB distributions. Genes passing the KS test will be then modeled using GLMs. Model selection is done by calculating the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic.",

    "description": "Provides functions for evaluating the stability of low-dimensional embeddings and cluster assignments in single‑cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‑seq) datasets. Starting from a principal component analysis (PCA) object, users can generate multiple replicates of t‑Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t‑SNE) or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embeddings. Embedding stability is quantified by computing pairwise Kendall’s Tau correlations across replicates and summarizing the distribution of correlation coefficients. In addition to dimensionality reduction, 'scStability' assesses clustering consistency using either Louvain or Leiden algorithms and calculating the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between all pairs of cluster assignments. For background on UMAP and t-SNE algorithms, see McInnes et al. (2020, <doi:10.21105/joss.00861>) and van der Maaten & Hinton (2008, <https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne>), respectively.",

One way to explicitly model publication bias is via selection models or weighted probability distributions. In this package we provide implementations of several parametric and nonparametric weight functions. The novelty in Rufibach (2011) is the proposal of a non-increasing variant of the nonparametric weight function of Dear & Begg (1992). The new approach potentially offers more insight in the selection process than other methods, but is more flexible than parametric approaches. To maximize the log-likelihood function proposed by Dear & Begg (1992) under a monotonicity constraint we use a differential evolution algorithm proposed by Ardia et al (2010a, b) and implemented in Mullen et al (2009). In addition, we offer a method to compute a confidence interval for the overall effect size theta, adjusted for selection bias as well as a function that computes the simulation-based p-value to assess the null hypothesis of no selection as described in Rufibach (2011, Section 6).",

With additional available information such as the TPM values and interquantile widths (IQWs) of the CAGE tag clusters, seqArchRplus can order the input promoter clusters by their shape (IQWs), and write the cluster information as browser/IGV track files. Provided visualizations are of two kind: per sample/stage and per cluster visualizations. Those of the first kind include: plot panels for each sample showing per cluster shape, TPM and other score distributions, sequence logos, and peak annotations. The second include per cluster chromosome-wise and strand distributions, motif occurrence heatmaps and GO term enrichments. Additionally, seqArchRplus can also generate HTML reports for easy viewing and comparison of promoter architectures between samples/stages.",

Both semiparametric and nonparametric approaches consider two scenarios: (1) the mark is fully observed in all subjects who experience the event of interest, and (2) the mark is subject to missingness-at-random in subjects who experience the event of interest. For models with missing marks, estimators are implemented based on (i) inverse probability weighting (IPW) of complete cases (for the semiparametric framework), and (ii) augmentation of the IPW estimating functions by leveraging correlations between the mark and auxiliary data to 'impute' the augmentation term for subjects with missing marks (for both the semiparametric and nonparametric framework). The augmented IPW estimators are doubly robust and recommended for use with incomplete mark data. The semiparametric methods make two key assumptions: (i) the time-to-event is assumed to be conditionally independent of the mark given treatment, and (ii) the weight function in the semiparametric density ratio/biased sampling model is assumed to be exponential. Diagnostic testing procedures for evaluating validity of both assumptions are implemented. Summary and plotting functions are provided for estimation and inferential results.",

    "title": "Handling Heteroskedasticity in the Linear Regression Model",
    "description": "Implements numerous methods for testing for, modelling, and \n    correcting for heteroskedasticity in the classical linear regression \n    model. The most novel contribution of the \n    package is found in the functions that implement the as-yet-unpublished \n    auxiliary linear variance models and auxiliary nonlinear variance \n    models that are designed to estimate error variances in a heteroskedastic \n    linear regression model. These models follow principles of statistical \n    learning described in Hastie (2009) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-21606-5>. \n    The nonlinear version of the model is estimated using quasi-likelihood \n    methods as described in Seber and Wild (2003, ISBN: 0-471-47135-6).\n    Bootstrap methods for approximate confidence intervals for error variances \n    are implemented as described in Efron and Tibshirani \n    (1993, ISBN: 978-1-4899-4541-9), including also the expansion technique \n    described in Hesterberg (2014) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2015.1089789>. The \n    wild bootstrap employed here follows the description in Davidson and \n    Flachaire (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2008.08.003>. Tuning of \n    hyper-parameters makes use of a golden section search function that is \n    modelled after the MATLAB function of Zarnowiec (2022) \n    <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25919-golden-section-method-algorithm>.\n    A methodological description of the algorithm can be found in Fox (2021, \n    ISBN: 978-1-003-00957-3).\n    There are 25 different functions that implement hypothesis tests for \n    heteroskedasticity.

    "description": "Functionality for spatio-temporal modeling of large data sets is provided. A Gaussian process in space and time is defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The SPDE is solved in the spectral space, and after discretizing in time and space, a linear Gaussian state space model is obtained. When doing inference, the main computational difficulty consists in evaluating the likelihood and in sampling from the full conditional of the spectral coefficients, or equivalently, the latent space-time process. In comparison to the traditional approach of using a spatio-temporal covariance function, the spectral SPDE approach is computationally advantageous. See Sigrist, Kuensch, and Stahel (2015) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12061> for more information on the methodology. This package aims at providing tools for two different modeling approaches. First, the SPDE based spatio-temporal model can be used as a component in a customized hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). The functions of the package then provide parameterizations of the process part of the model as well as computationally efficient algorithms needed for doing inference with the HBM. Alternatively, the adaptive MCMC algorithm implemented in the package can be used as an algorithm for doing inference without any additional modeling. The MCMC algorithm supports data that follow a Gaussian or a censored distribution with point mass at zero. Covariates can be included in the model through a regression term.",

Thus the sscu index is comparable among different species. (2) The package can detect the strength of translational accuracy selection by Akashi's test.

This process includes automatic calculation of optimal raster resolution and extent for the sample. A neighbors list is then created from the rasterized sample, in which adjacent and diagonal neighbors for each pixel are identified. After adding binary spatial weights to the neighbors list, a multi-categorical join count analysis is performed to tabulate \"joins\" between all possible combinations of label pairs. The function returns the observed join counts, the expected count under conditions of spatial randomness, and the variance calculated under non-free sampling. The z-score is then calculated as the difference between observed and expected counts, divided by the square root of the variance.",

Alternatively spliced surface protein isoforms have been shown to differ in their subcellular localization and/or their transmembrane (TM) topology. Surface proteins are hydrophobic and remain difficult to study thereby necessitating the use of TM topology prediction methods such as TMHMM and Phobius. However, there exists a need for bioinformatic approaches to streamline batch processing of isoforms for comparing and visualizing topologies. To address this gap, we have developed an R package, surfaltr. It pairs inputted isoforms, either known alternatively spliced or novel, with their APPRIS annotated principal counterparts, predicts their TM topologies using TMHMM or Phobius, and generates a customizable graphical output. Further, surfaltr facilitates the prioritization of biologically diverse isoform pairs through the incorporation of three different ranking metrics and through protein alignment functions.

The software has applications that extend to multiple species and to the analysis of other proteins that label meiotic prophase chromosomes. The software converts meiotic immunofluorescence images into R data frames that are compatible with machine learning methods. Given a set of microscopy images of meiotic spread slides, synapsis crops images around individual single cells, counts colocalising foci on strands on a per cell basis, and measures the distance between foci on any given strand.",

    "description": "A robust implementation of Topolow algorithm. It embeds objects into a low-dimensional Euclidean space from a matrix of pairwise dissimilarities, even when the data do not satisfy metric or Euclidean axioms. The package is particularly well-suited for sparse, incomplete, and censored (thresholded) datasets such as antigenic relationships. The core is a physics-inspired, gradient-free optimization framework that models objects as particles in a physical system, where observed dissimilarities define spring rest lengths and unobserved pairs exert repulsive forces. The package also provides functions specific to antigenic mapping to transform cross-reactivity and binding affinity measurements into accurate spatial representations in a phenotype space.\n    Key features include:\n    * Robust Embedding from Sparse Data: Effectively creates complete and consistent maps (in optimal dimensions) even with high proportions of missing data (e.g., >95%).\n    * Physics-Inspired Optimization: Models objects (e.g., antigens, landmarks) as particles connected by springs (for measured dissimilarities) and subject to repulsive forces (for missing dissimilarities), and simulates the physical system using laws of mechanics, reducing the need for complex gradient computations.\n    * Automatic Dimensionality Detection: Employs a likelihood-based approach to determine the optimal number of dimensions for the embedding/map, avoiding distortions common in methods with fixed low dimensions.\n    * Noise and Bias Reduction: Naturally mitigates experimental noise and bias through its network-based, error-dampening mechanism.\n    * Antigenic Velocity Calculation (for antigenic data): Introduces and quantifies \"antigenic velocity,\" a vector that describes the rate and direction of antigenic drift for each pathogen isolate. This can help identify cluster transitions and potential lineage replacements.\n    * Broad Applicability: Analyzes data from various objects that their dissimilarity may be of interest, ranging from complex biological measurements such as continuous and relational phenotypes, antibody-antigen interactions, and protein folding to abstract concepts, such as customer perception of different brands.\n    Methods are described in the context of bioinformatics applications in Arhami and Rohani (2025a) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf372>, and mathematical proofs and Euclidean embedding details are in Arhami and Rohani (2025b) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2508.01733>.",

    "description": "The differences in the RNA types being sequenced have an impact on the resulting sequencing profiles. mRNA-seq data is enriched with reads derived from exons, while GRO-, nucRNA- and chrRNA-seq demonstrate a substantial broader coverage of both exonic and intronic regions. The presence of intronic reads in GRO-seq type of data makes it possible to use it to computationally identify and quantify all de novo continuous regions of transcription distributed across the genome. This type of data, however, is more challenging to interpret and less common practice compared to mRNA-seq. One of the challenges for primary transcript detection concerns the simultaneous transcription of closely spaced genes, which needs to be properly divided into individually transcribed units. The R package transcriptR combines RNA-seq data with ChIP-seq data of histone modifications that mark active Transcription Start Sites (TSSs), such as, H3K4me3 or H3K9/14Ac to overcome this challenge. The advantage of this approach over the use of, for example, gene annotations is that this approach is data driven and therefore able to deal also with novel and case specific events. Furthermore, the integration of ChIP- and RNA-seq data allows the identification all known and novel active transcription start sites within a given sample.",

The package accompanies the book \n    ''Tree balance indices: a comprehensive survey'' by M. Fischer, L. Herbst, S. Kersting, \n    L. Kuehn and K. Wicke (2023) <ISBN: 978-3-031-39799-8>, <doi:10.1007/978-3-031-39800-1>, which gives a precise definition for the terms 'balance index' and 'imbalance index' (Chapter 4)\n    and provides an overview of the terminology in this manual (Chapter 2). For further information \n    on (im)balance indices, see also Fischer et al. (2021) <https://treebalance.wordpress.com>.\n    Considering both established and new (im)balance indices, 'treebalance' provides (among \n    others) functions for calculating the following 18 established indices and index families: the \n    average leaf depth, the B1 and B2 index, the Colijn-Plazzotta rank, the normal, corrected, \n    quadratic and equal weights Colless index, the family of Colless-like indices, the family of \n    I-based indices, the Rogers J index, the Furnas rank, the rooted quartet index, the s-shape \n    statistic, the Sackin index, the symmetry nodes index, the total cophenetic index and the \n    variance of leaf depths. Additionally, we include 9 tree shape statistics that satisfy the \n    definition of an (im)balance index but have not been thoroughly analyzed in terms of tree \n    balance in the literature yet. These are: the total internal path length, the total path length, \n    the average vertex depth, the maximum width, the modified maximum difference in widths, the \n    maximum depth, the maximum width over maximum depth, the stairs1 and the stairs2 index. \n    As input, most functions of 'treebalance' require a rooted (phylogenetic) tree in 'phylo' format \n    (as introduced in 'ape' 1.9 in November 2006). 'phylo' is used to store (phylogenetic) trees \n    with no vertices of out-degree one. For further information on the format we kindly refer the \n    reader to E.

    "description": "A framework for dynamically combining forecasting models for time series forecasting predictive tasks. It leverages machine learning models from other packages to automatically combine expert advice using metalearning and other state-of-the-art forecasting combination approaches. The predictive methods receive a data matrix as input, representing an embedded time series, and return a predictive ensemble model. The ensemble use generic functions 'predict()' and 'forecast()' to forecast future values of the time series. Moreover, an ensemble can be updated using methods, such as 'update_weights()' or 'update_base_models()'. A complete description of the methods can be found in: Cerqueira, V., Torgo, L., Pinto, F., and Soares, C. \"Arbitrated Ensemble for Time Series Forecasting.\" to appear at: Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

GSEA is a powerful method to infer results of gene expression data at a level of gene sets by calculating enrichment scores for predefined sets of genes. GSEA depends on the availability and accuracy of gene sets. There are overlaps between terms of gene sets or categories because multiple terms may exist for a single biological process, and it can thus lead to redundancy within enriched terms. In other words, the sets of related terms are overlapping. Using deep learning, this pakage is aimed to predict enrichment scores for unique tokens or words from text in names of gene sets to resolve this overlapping set issue. Furthermore, we can coin a new term by combining tokens and find its enrichment score by predicting such a combined tokens.",

The resulting curve of p-values versus local false discovery rate offers an insight into the twilight zone between clear differential and clear non-differential gene expression. Package 'twilight' contains two main functions: Function twilight.pval performs a two-condition test on differences in means for a given input matrix or expression set and computes permutation based p-values. Function twilight performs a stochastic downhill search to estimate local false discovery rates and effect size distributions. The package further provides means to filter for permutations that describe the null distribution correctly. Using filtered permutations, the influence of hidden confounders could be diminished.",

To facilitate their applications, 'variationalDCM' is developed to provide a collection of recently-proposed variational Bayesian estimation methods for various DCMs.",

It can also be used for data from other technologies, as long as they have similar format. The method uses a robust variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator for an additive-multiplicative error model and affine calibration. The model incorporates data calibration step (a.k.a. normalization), a model for the dependence of the variance on the mean intensity and a variance stabilizing data transformation. Differences between transformed intensities are analogous to \"normalized log-ratios\". However, in contrast to the latter, their variance is independent of the mean, and they are usually more sensitive and specific in detecting differential transcription.",

It is provided here in a small zero-dependency package. It can\n be used from R as well as from 'C/C++' code in other packages as is demonstrated\n by four included sample packages using four distinct methods to use the PRNG\n presented here in client package. The implementation is influenced by our\n package 'RcppZiggurat' which offers a comparison among multiple alternative\n implementations but presented here in a lighter-weight implementation that is\n easier to use by other packages. The PRNGs provided are generally faster than\n the ones in base R: on our machine, the relative gains for normal, exponential\n and uniform are on the order of 7.4, 5.2 and 4.7 times faster than base R.\n However, these generators are of potentially lesser quality and shorter period\n so if in doubt use of the base R functions remains the general recommendation.",

    "description": "zitools allows for zero inflated count data analysis by either using down-weighting of excess zeros or by replacing an appropriate proportion of excess zeros with NA. Through overloading frequently used statistical functions (such as mean, median, standard deviation), plotting functions (such as boxplots or heatmap) or differential abundance tests, it allows a wide range of downstream analyses for zero-inflated data in a less biased manner. This becomes applicable in the context of microbiome analyses, where the data is often overdispersed and zero-inflated, therefore making data analysis extremly challenging.",
