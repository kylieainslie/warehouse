With these, while solving the differential\nequations, no allocations are done and the calculations remain\nentirely in compiled code.  Alternatively, a model can be\ntranspiled to R for use in contexts where a C compiler is not\npresent.  After compilation, models can be inspected to return\ninformation about parameters and outputs, or intermediate\nvalues after calculations. 'odin' is not targeted at any\nparticular domain and is suitable for any system that can be\nexpressed primarily as mathematical expressions.  Additional\nsupport is provided for working with delays (delay differential\nequations, DDE), using interpolated functions during\ninterpolation, and for integrating quantities that represent\narrays.",

It is therefore especially suited for\ntimeseries and panel data. A function for leave-one-out CRPS\nmay be added in the future. Predictions need to be predictive\ndistributions represented by predictive samples. Usually, these\nwill be sets of posterior predictive simulation draws generated\nby an MCMC algorithm. Given some training data with true\nobserved values as well as predictive samples generated from\ndifferent models, `crps_weights` finds the optimal (in the\nsense of minimizing expected cross-validation predictive error)\nweights to form an ensemble from these models. Using these\nweights, `mixture_from_samples` can then provide samples from\nthe optimal model mixture by drawing from the predictice\nsamples of the individual models in the correct proportion.\nThis gives a mixture model solely based on predictive samples\nand is in this regard superior to other ensembling techniques\nlike Bayesian Model Averaging.",

    "title": "Geographical Risk Analysis Based on Habitat Connectivity",
    "description": "The 'geohabnet' package is designed to perform a\ngeographically or spatially explicit risk analysis of habitat\nconnectivity. Xing et al (2021) <doi:10.1093/biosci/biaa067>\nproposed the concept of cropland connectivity as a risk factor\nfor plant pathogen or pest invasions. As the functions in\n'geohabnet' were initially developed thinking on cropland\nconnectivity, users are recommended to first be familiar with\nthe concept by looking at the Xing et al paper. In a nutshell,\na habitat connectivity analysis combines information from maps\nof host density, estimates the relative likelihood of pathogen\nmovement between habitat locations in the area of interest, and\napplies network analysis to calculate the connectivity of\nhabitat locations. The functions of 'geohabnet' are built to\nconduct a habitat connectivity analysis relying on geographic\nparameters (spatial resolution and spatial extent), dispersal\nparameters (in two commonly used dispersal kernels: inverse\npower law and negative exponential models), and network\nparameters (link weight thresholds and network metrics). The\nfunctionality and main extensions provided by the functions in\n'geohabnet' to habitat connectivity analysis are a) Capability\nto easily calculate the connectivity of locations in a\nlandscape using a single function, such as\nsensitivity_analysis() or msean(). b) As backbone datasets, the\n'geohabnet' package supports the use of two publicly available\nglobal datasets to calculate cropland density. The backbone\ndatasets in the 'geohabnet' package include crop distribution\nmaps from Monfreda, C., N. Ramankutty, and J. A. Foley (2008)\n<doi:10.1029/2007gb002947> \"Farming the planet: 2. Geographic\ndistribution of crop areas, yields, physiological types, and\nnet primary production in the year 2000, Global Biogeochem.\nCycles, 22, GB1022\" and International Food Policy Research\nInstitute (2019) <doi:10.7910/DVN/PRFF8V> \"Global\nSpatially-Disaggregated Crop Production Statistics Data for\n2010 Version 2.0, Harvard Dataverse, V4\". Users can also\nprovide any other geographic dataset that represents host\ndensity. c) Because the 'geohabnet' package allows R users to\nprovide maps of host density (as originally in Xing et al\n(2021)), host landscape density (representing the geographic\ndistribution of either crops or wild species), or habitat\ndistribution (such as host landscape density adjusted by\nclimate suitability) as inputs, we propose the term habitat\nconnectivity. d) The 'geohabnet' package allows R users to\ncustomize parameter values in the habitat connectivity\nanalysis, facilitating context-specific (pathogen- or\npest-specific) analyses. e) The 'geohabnet' package allows\nusers to automatically visualize maps of the habitat\nconnectivity of locations resulting from a sensitivity analysis\nacross all customized parameter combinations. The primary\nfunctions are msean() and sensitivity analysis(). Most\nfunctions in 'geohabnet' provide three main outcomes: i) A map\nof mean habitat connectivity across parameters selected by the\nuser, ii) a map of variance of habitat connectivity across the\nselected parameters, and iii) a map of the difference between\nthe ranks of habitat connectivity and habitat density. Each\nfunction can be used to generate these maps as 'final'\noutcomes. Each function can also provide intermediate outcomes,\nsuch as the adjacency matrices built to perform the analysis,\nwhich can be used in other network analysis. Refer to article\nat\n<https://garrettlab.github.io/HabitatConnectivity/articles/analysis.html>\nto see examples of each function and how to access each of\nthese outcome types. To change parameter values, the file\ncalled 'parameters.yaml' stores the parameters and their\nvalues, can be accessed using 'get_parameters()' and set new\nparameter values with 'set_parameters()'. Users can modify up\nto ten parameters.",

Further flexibility is provided\nby the hierarchical prior structure that retains the Minnesota\nprior interpretation for the global VAR and features estimated\nprior covariance matrices, shrinkage, and persistence levels.\nBayesian forecasting is developed for models including\nexogenous variables, allowing conditional forecasts given the\nfuture trajectories of some variables and restricted forecasts\nassuring that rates are forecasted to stay positive and less\nthan 100.

    "title": "Agent Based Model Simulation Framework",
    "description": "A high-performance, flexible and extensible framework to\n    develop continuous-time agent based models. Its high performance\n    allows it to simulate millions of agents efficiently. Agents are\n    defined by their states (arbitrary R lists). The events are handled in\n    chronological order. This avoids the multi-event interaction problem\n    in a time step of discrete-time simulations, and gives precise\n    outcomes. The states are modified by provided or user-defined events.\n    The framework provides a flexible and customizable implementation of\n    state transitions (either spontaneous or caused by agent\n    interactions), making the framework suitable to apply to epidemiology\n    and ecology, e.g., to model life history stages, competition and\n    cooperation, and disease and information spread. The agent\n    interactions are flexible and extensible. The framework provides\n    random mixing and network interactions, and supports multi-level\n    mixing patterns.  It can be easily extended to other interactions such\n    as inter- and intra-households (or workplaces and schools) by\n    subclassing an R6 class. It can be used to study the effect of\n    age-specific, group-specific, and contact- specific intervention\n    strategies, and complex interactions between individual behavior and\n    population dynamics. This modeling concept can also be used in\n    business, economical and political models. As a generic event based\n    framework, it can be applied to many other fields. More information\n    about the implementation and examples can be found at\n    <https://github.com/junlingm/ABM>.",

    "description": "Inflammation can affect many micronutrient biomarkers and can thus lead to incorrect diagnosis of individuals and to over- or under-estimate the prevalence of deficiency in a population. Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) is a multi-agency and multi-country partnership designed to improve the interpretation of nutrient biomarkers in settings of inflammation and to generate context-specific estimates of risk factors for anemia (Suchdev (2016) <doi:10.3945/an.115.010215>). In the past few years, BRINDA published a series of papers to provide guidance on how to adjust micronutrient biomarkers, retinol binding protein, serum retinol, serum ferritin by Namaste (2020), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), serum zinc, serum and Red Blood Cell (RBC) folate, and serum B-12, using inflammation markers, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and/or C-Reactive Protein (CRP) by Namaste (2020) <doi:10.1093/ajcn/nqaa141>, Rohner (2017) <doi:10.3945/ajcn.116.142232>, McDonald (2020) <doi:10.1093/ajcn/nqz304>, and Young (2020) <doi:10.1093/ajcn/nqz303>. The BRINDA inflammation adjustment method mainly focuses on Women of Reproductive Age (WRA) and Preschool-age Children (PSC); however, the general principle of the BRINDA method might apply to other population groups. The BRINDA R package is a user-friendly all-in-one R package that uses a series of functions to implement BRINDA adjustment method, as described above. The BRINDA R package will first carry out rigorous checks and provides users guidance to correct data or input errors (if they occur) prior to inflammation adjustments. After no errors are detected, the package implements the BRINDA inflammation adjustment for up to five micronutrient biomarkers, namely retinol-binding-protein, serum retinol, serum ferritin, sTfR, and serum zinc (when appropriate), using inflammation indicators of AGP and/or CRP for various population groups. Of note, adjustment for serum and RBC folate and serum B-12 is not included in the R package, since evidence shows that no adjustment is needed for these micronutrient biomarkers in either WRA or PSC groups (Young (2020) <doi:10.1093/ajcn/nqz303>).",

    "description": "Statistical classification and regression have been popular among various fields and stayed in the limelight of scientists of those fields. Examples of the fields include clinical trials where the statistical classification of patients is indispensable to predict the clinical courses of diseases. Considering the negative impact of diseases on performing daily tasks, correctly classifying patients based on the clinical information is vital in that we need to identify patients of the high-risk group to develop a severe state and arrange medical treatment for them at an opportune moment. Deep learning - a part of artificial intelligence - has gained much attention, and research on it burgeons during past decades: see, e.g, Kazemi and Mirroshandel (2018) <DOI:10.1016/j.artmed.2017.12.001>. It is a veritable technique which was originally designed for the classification, and hence, the Buddle package can provide sublime solutions to various challenging classification and regression problems encountered in the clinical trials. The Buddle package is based on the back-propagation algorithm - together with various powerful techniques such as batch normalization and dropout - which performs a multi-layer feed-forward neural network: see Krizhevsky et. al (2017) <DOI:10.1145/3065386>, Schmidhuber (2015) <DOI:10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003> and LeCun et al. (1998) <DOI:10.1109/5.726791> for more details. This package contains two main functions: TrainBuddle() and FetchBuddle(). TrainBuddle() builds a feed-forward neural network model and trains the model. FetchBuddle() recalls the trained model which is the output of TrainBuddle(), classifies or regresses given data, and make a final prediction for the data.",

Due to the small effect sizes of common variants, the power to detect individual risk variants is generally low. Complementary to SNP-level analysis, a variety of gene-based association tests have been proposed. However, the power of existing gene-based tests is often dependent on the underlying genetic models, and it is not known a priori which test is optimal.  Here we proposed COMBined Association Test (COMBAT) to incorporate strengths from multiple existing gene-based tests, including VEGAS, GATES and simpleM. Compared to individual tests, COMBAT shows higher overall performance and robustness across a wide range of genetic models. The algorithm behind this method is described in Wang et al (2017) <doi:10.1534/genetics.117.300257>.",

Recently, we found that the newly incorporated spacer in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) could serve as an effective marker for typing of Salmonella. It was further revealed by Li et. al (2014) <doi:10.1128/JCM.00696-14> that recognized types based on the combination of two newly incorporated spacer in both CRISPR loci showed high accordance with serotypes. Here, we developed an R package 'CSESA' to predict the serotype based on this finding.

The package also includes non-parametric significance tests, that can be applied to test whether the contingency value quantifying the relationship between the variables is significantly higher than chance level. Most importantly this test accounts for auto-dependence and relative frequency.See Bodner et al.(2021) <doi: 10.1111/bmsp.12222>.Finally, a network can be drawn. Variables depicted the nodes of the network, with the node size adapted to the prevalence. The association strength between the variables defines the undirected (concurrent) or directed (temporal sequenced) links between the nodes. The results of the non-parametric significance test can be included by depicting either all links or only the significant ones. Tutorial see Bodner et al.(2021) <doi:10.3758/s13428-021-01760-w>.",

It follows that the asymptotic confidence intervals\n for parameters may not always be reliable. As an alternative, this package allows for the\n construction of bootstrap confidence intervals based on empirical quantiles for the parameters\n of the 2-D spatial and temporal 'ETAS' model.

    "description": "Description: For the risk, progression, and response to treatment of many complex diseases, it has been increasingly recognized that gene-environment interactions play important roles beyond the main genetic and environmental effects. In practical interaction analyses, outliers in response variables and covariates are not uncommon. In addition, missingness in environmental factors is routinely encountered in epidemiological studies. The developed package consists of five robust approaches to address the outliers problems, among which two approaches can also accommodate missingness in environmental factors. Both continuous and right censored responses are considered. The proposed approaches are based on penalization and sparse boosting techniques for identifying important interactions, which are realized using efficient algorithms. Beyond the gene-environment analysis, the developed package can also be adopted to conduct analysis on interactions between other types of low-dimensional and high-dimensional data.

'Haplin' estimates relative risk (RR + conf.int.) and p-value associated with each haplotype. It uses maximum likelihood estimation to make optimal use of data from triads with missing genotypic data, for instance if some SNPs has not been typed for some individuals. 'Haplin' also allows estimation of effects of maternal haplotypes and parent-of-origin effects, particularly appropriate in perinatal epidemiology. 'Haplin' allows special models, like X-inactivation, to be fitted on the X-chromosome. A GxE analysis allows testing interactions between environment and all estimated genetic effects.

Unweighted integration\n    is performed considering the average, per-edge average, maximum and minimum of\n    networks edges. Weighted integration takes into account a weight for each \n    network during the fusion process, where the weights express\n    the ''predictiveness strength'' of each network considering a specific predictive\n    task. Weights can be learned using a machine learning algorithm able to associate\n    the weights to the assessment of the accuracy of the learning algorithm \n    trained on the network itself. The implemented methods can be applied to \n    effectively integrate different biological networks modelling a wide range\n    of problems in bioinformatics (e.g. disease gene prioritization, protein\n    function prediction, drug repurposing, clinical outcome prediction).",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence Systems and Observer Performance",
    "description": "Analyzing the performance of artificial intelligence\n (AI) systems/algorithms characterized by a 'search-and-report'\n strategy. Historically observer performance has dealt with\n measuring radiologists' performances in search tasks, e.g., searching\n for lesions in medical images and reporting them, but the implicit\n location information has been ignored. The implemented methods apply\n to analyzing the absolute and relative performances of AI systems,\n comparing AI performance to a group of human readers or optimizing the\n reporting threshold of an AI system. In addition to performing historical\n receiver operating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis\n (localization information ignored), the software also performs\n free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC)\n analysis, where lesion localization information is used. A book\n using the software has been published: Chakraborty DP: Observer\n Performance Methods for Diagnostic Imaging - Foundations, Modeling,\n and Applications with R-Based Examples, Taylor-Francis LLC; 2017:\n <https://www.routledge.com/Observer-Performance-Methods-for-Diagnostic-Imaging-Foundations-Modeling/Chakraborty/p/book/9781482214840>.\n Online updates to this book, which use the software, are at\n <https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocQuickStart/>,\n <https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocRocBook/> and at\n <https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocFrocBook/>. Supported data\n collection paradigms are the ROC, FROC and the location ROC (LROC).\n ROC data consists of single ratings per images, where a rating is\n the perceived confidence level that the image is that of a diseased\n patient. An ROC curve is a plot of true positive fraction vs. false\n positive fraction. FROC data consists of a variable number (zero or\n more) of mark-rating pairs per image, where a mark is the location\n of a reported suspicious region and the rating is the confidence\n level that it is a real lesion. LROC data consists of a rating and a\n location of the most suspicious region, for every image. Four models\n of observer performance, and curve-fitting software, are implemented:\n the binormal model (BM), the contaminated binormal model (CBM), the\n correlated contaminated binormal model (CORCBM), and the radiological\n search model (RSM). Unlike the binormal model, CBM, CORCBM and RSM\n predict 'proper' ROC curves that do not inappropriately cross the\n chance diagonal. Additionally, RSM parameters are related to search\n performance (not measured in conventional ROC analysis) and\n classification performance. Search performance refers to finding\n lesions, i.e., true positives, while simultaneously not finding false\n positive locations. Classification performance measures the ability to\n distinguish between true and false positive locations. Knowing these\n separate performances allows principled optimization of reader or AI\n system performance. This package supersedes Windows JAFROC (jackknife\n alternative FROC) software V4.2.1,\n <https://github.com/dpc10ster/WindowsJafroc>. Package functions are\n organized as follows. Data file related function names are preceded\n by 'Df', curve fitting functions by 'Fit', included data sets by 'dataset',\n plotting functions by 'Plot', significance testing functions by 'St',\n sample size related functions by 'Ss', data simulation functions by\n 'Simulate' and utility functions by 'Util'. Implemented are figures of\n merit (FOMs) for quantifying performance and functions for visualizing\n empirical or fitted operating characteristics: e.g., ROC, FROC, alternative\n FROC (AFROC) and weighted AFROC (wAFROC) curves. For fully crossed study\n designs significance testing of reader-averaged FOM differences between\n modalities is implemented via either Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz or the\n Obuchowski-Rockette methods. Also implemented is single treatment analysis,\n which allows comparison of performance of a group of radiologists to a\n specified value, or comparison of AI to a group of radiologists interpreting\n the same cases. Crossed-modality analysis is implemented wherein there are\n two crossed treatment factors and the aim is to determined performance in\n each treatment factor averaged over all levels of the second factor. Sample\n size estimation tools are provided for ROC and FROC studies; these use\n estimates of the relevant variances from a pilot study to predict required\n numbers of readers and cases in a pivotal study to achieve the desired power.\n Utility and data file manipulation functions allow data to be read in any of\n the currently used input formats, including Excel, and the results of the\n analysis can be viewed in text or Excel output files. The methods are\n illustrated with several included datasets from the author's collaborations.\n This update includes improvements to the code, some as a result of\n user-reported bugs and new feature requests, and others discovered during\n ongoing testing and code simplification.",

    "title": "Simulating Multistate Movements in River/Heterogeneous\nLandscapes",
    "description": "Provides functions to generate and analyze spatially-explicit individual-based multistate movements in rivers,\n  heterogeneous and homogeneous spaces. This is done by incorporating landscape bias on local behaviour, based on\n  resistance rasters. Although originally conceived and designed to simulate trajectories of species constrained to\n  linear habitats/dendritic ecological networks (e.g. river networks), the simulation algorithm is built to be\n  highly flexible and can be applied to any (aquatic, semi-aquatic or terrestrial) organism, independently on the\n  landscape in which it moves. Thus, the user will be able to use the package to simulate movements either in\n  homogeneous landscapes, heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. semi-aquatic animal moving mainly along rivers but also using\n  the matrix), or even in highly contrasted landscapes (e.g. fish in a river network). The algorithm and its input\n  parameters are the same for all cases, so that results are comparable. Simulated trajectories can then be used as\n  mechanistic null models (Potts & Lewis 2014, <DOI:10.1098/rspb.2014.0231>) to test a variety of 'Movement Ecology'\n  hypotheses (Nathan et al. 2008, <DOI:10.1073/pnas.0800375105>), including landscape effects (e.g. resources, \n  infrastructures) on animal movement and species site fidelity, or for predictive purposes (e.g. road mortality risk,\n  dispersal/connectivity). The package should be relevant to explore a broad spectrum of ecological phenomena, such as\n  those at the interface of animal behaviour, management, landscape and movement ecology, disease and invasive species\n  spread, and population dynamics.",

GA is used to control and optimize the subset of genes sent to the SVM for classification and evaluation. Genetic algorithm uses repeated learning steps and cross validation over number of possible solution and selects the best.

This package implements\n    a nonparametric estimator for the conditional cumulative incidence function\n    and a nonparametric conditional bivariate cumulative incidence function for the\n    bivariate gap times proposed in Huang et al. (2016) <doi:10.1111/biom.12494>.",

It allows the simulation of spectral datasets in the solar spectrum (400-2500nm) using leaf models as PROSPECT5, 5b, and D which can be coupled with canopy models as 'FLIM', 'SAIL' and 'SAIL2'. Currently, only a simple atmospheric model ('skyl') is implemented. Jacquemoud et al 2008 provide the most comprehensive overview of these models <doi:10.1016/j.rse.2008.01.026>. ",

Misrepresentation typically arises when there is an incentive for the binary factor to be misclassified in one direction (e.g., in insurance settings where policy holders may purposely deny a risk status in order to lower the insurance premium). This is accomplished by treating a subset of the response variable as resulting from a mixture distribution. Model parameters are estimated via the Expectation Maximization algorithm and standard errors of the estimates are obtained from closed forms of the Observed Fisher Information. For an introduction to the models and the misrepresentation framework, see Xia et. al., (2023) <https://variancejournal.org/article/73151-maximum-likelihood-approaches-to-misrepresentation-models-in-glm-ratemaking-model-comparisons>.",

Win odds, also called Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney or success odds, is the main analysis method. Other win statistics (win probability, win ratio, net benefit) are also implemented in the univariate case, provided there is no censoring. The win probability analysis is based on the Brunner-Munzel test and uses the DeLong-DeLong-Clarke-Pearson variance estimator, as described by Brunner and Konietschke (2025) in “An unbiased rank-based estimator of the Mann–Whitney variance including the case of ties” (Statistical Papers 66 (1): 20, <doi:10.1007/s00362-024-01635-0>).

    "description": "We provide functions for identifying the core community phylogeny in any microbiome, drawing phylogenetic Venn diagrams, calculating the core Faith’s PD for a set of communities, and calculating the core UniFrac distance between two sets of communities. All functions rely on construction of a core community phylogeny, which is a phylogeny where branches are defined based on their presence in multiple samples from a single type of habitat. Our package provides two options for constructing the core community phylogeny, a tip-based approach, where the core community phylogeny is identified based on incidence of leaf nodes and a branch-based approach, where the core community phylogeny is identified based on incidence of individual branches. We suggest use of the microViz package.",

    "description": "In many binary classification applications, such as disease\n    diagnosis and spam detection, practitioners commonly face the need to limit\n    type I error (i.e., the conditional probability of misclassifying a class 0\n    observation as class 1) so that it remains below a desired threshold. To address\n    this need, the Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification paradigm is a natural choice;\n    it minimizes type II error (i.e., the conditional probability of misclassifying\n    a class 1 observation as class 0) while enforcing an upper bound, alpha, on the\n    type I error. Although the NP paradigm has a century-long history in hypothesis\n    testing, it has not been well recognized and implemented in classification\n    schemes. Common practices that directly limit the empirical type I error to\n    no more than alpha do not satisfy the type I error control objective because\n    the resulting classifiers are still likely to have type I errors much larger\n    than alpha. As a result, the NP paradigm has not been properly implemented\n    for many classification scenarios in practice. In this work, we develop the\n    first umbrella algorithm that implements the NP paradigm for all scoring-type\n    classification methods, including popular methods such as logistic regression,\n    support vector machines and random forests. Powered by this umbrella algorithm,\n    we propose a novel graphical tool for NP classification methods: NP receiver\n    operating characteristic (NP-ROC) bands, motivated by the popular receiver\n    operating characteristic (ROC) curves. NP-ROC bands will help choose in a data\n    adaptive way and compare different NP classifiers. ",

The optimal threshold is the marker value that maximizes the utility of the marker based-strategy (for diagnostic or treatment selection) in a given population. The utility function depends on the type of marker (diagnostic or treatment selection), but always takes into account the preferences of the patients or the physician in the decision process. For estimating the optimal threshold, ones must specify the distributions of the marker in different groups (defined according to the type of marker, diagnostic or treatment selection) and provides data to estimate the parameters of these distributions. Ones must also provide some features of the target populations (disease prevalence or treatment efficacies) as well as the preferences of patients or physicians. The functions rely on Bayesian inference which helps producing several indicators derived from the optimal threshold.

    "description": "Early generation breeding trials are to be conducted in multiple \n             environments where it may not be possible to replicate all the \n             lines in each environment due to scarcity of resources. For such \n             situations, partially replicated (p-Rep) designs have wide \n             application potential as only a proportion of the test lines are \n             replicated at each environment. A collection of several utility \n             functions related to p-Rep designs have been developed. Here, the \n             package contains six functions for a complete stepwise analytical \n             study of these designs. Five functions pRep1(), pRep2(), pRep3(), \n             pRep4() and pRep5(), are used to generate five new series of p-Rep \n             designs and also compute average variance factors and canonical \n             efficiency factors of generated designs. A fourth function NCEV() \n             is used to generate incidence matrix (N), information matrix (C), \n             canonical efficiency factor (E) and average variance factor (V). \n             This function is general in nature and can be used for studying the \n             characterization properties of any block design. A construction \n             procedure for p-Rep designs was given by Williams et al.(2011) \n             <doi:10.1002/bimj.201000102> which was tedious and time consuming. \n             Here, in this package, five different methods have been given to \n             generate p-Rep designs easily.",

Traditionally, \n             inference in multi-state models relies on the Aalen-Johansen (AJ) \n             estimator which is consistent under the Markov assumption. However, \n             in many practical applications, the Markovian nature of the process\n             is often not guaranteed, limiting the applicability of the AJ\n             estimator in more complex scenarios. This package extends the landmark Aalen-Johansen\n             estimator (Putter, H, Spitoni, C (2018) <doi:10.1177/0962280216674497>)\n             incorporating presmoothing techniques described by Soutinho, \n             Meira-Machado and Oliveira (2020) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2020.1762895>, \n             offering a robust alternative for estimating transition probabilities\n             in non-Markovian multi-state models with multiple states and potential\n             reversible transitions.",

This package performs analyses of corneal data obtained from a Placido disk corneal topographer, with the calculation of the Placido irregularity indices and the posterior analysis. The package is intended to be easy to use by a practitioner, providing a simple interface and yielding easily interpretable results. A corneal topographer is an ophthalmic clinical device that obtains measurements in the cornea (the anterior part of the eye). A Placido disk corneal topographer makes use of the Placido disk [Rowsey et al. (1981)]<doi:10.1001/archopht.1981.03930011093022>, which produce a circular pattern of measurement nodes. The raw information measured by such a topographer is used by practitioners to analyze curvatures, to study optical aberrations, or to diagnose specific conditions of the eye (e.g. keratoconus, an important corneal disease). The rPACI package allows the calculation of the corneal irregularity indices described in [Castro-Luna et al. (2020)]<doi:10.1016%2Fj.clae.2019.12.006>, [Ramos-Lopez et al. (2013)]<doi:10.1097%2FOPX.0b013e3182843f2a>, and [Ramos-Lopez et al. (2011)]<doi:10.1097/opx.0b013e3182279ff8>.

Given one or more risk prediction instruments (risk models) that estimate the probability of a binary outcome, rmda provides functions to estimate and display decision curves and other figures that help assess the population impact of using a risk model for clinical decision making.   Here, \"population\" refers to the relevant patient population. Decision curves display estimates of the (standardized) net benefit over a range of probability thresholds used to categorize observations as 'high risk'. The curves help evaluate a treatment policy that recommends treatment for patients who are estimated to be 'high risk' by comparing the population impact of a risk-based policy to \"treat all\" and \"treat none\" intervention policies.  Curves can be estimated using data from a prospective cohort.  In addition, rmda can estimate decision curves using data from a case-control study if an estimate of the population outcome prevalence is available.  Version 1.4 of the package provides an alternative framing of the decision problem for situations where treatment is the standard-of-care and a risk model might be used to recommend that low-risk patients (i.e., patients below some risk threshold) opt out of treatment. Confidence intervals calculated using the bootstrap can be computed and displayed. A wrapper function to calculate cross-validated curves using k-fold cross-validation is also provided. ",

    "description": "Fits (excess) hazard, relative mortality ratio or marginal intensity models with multidimensional penalized splines allowing for \n        time-dependent effects, non-linear effects and interactions between several continuous covariates. In survival and net survival analysis, in addition to modelling the effect of time (via the baseline hazard), one has often to deal with several continuous covariates and model their functional forms, their time-dependent effects, and their interactions. Model specification becomes therefore a complex problem and penalized regression splines represent an appealing solution to that problem as splines offer the required flexibility while penalization limits overfitting issues. Current implementations of penalized survival models can be slow or unstable and sometimes lack some key features like taking into account expected mortality to provide net survival and excess hazard estimates. In contrast, survPen provides an automated, fast, and stable implementation (thanks to explicit calculation of the derivatives of the likelihood) and offers a unified framework for \n        multidimensional penalized hazard and excess hazard models. Later versions (>2.0.0) include penalized models for relative mortality ratio, and marginal intensity in recurrent event setting.\n\tsurvPen may be of interest to those who 1) analyse any kind of time-to-event data: mortality, disease relapse, machinery breakdown, unemployment, etc 2) wish to describe the associated hazard and to understand which predictors impact its dynamics, \n\t3) wish to model the relative mortality ratio between a cohort and a reference population, 4) wish to describe the marginal intensity for recurrent event data. \n\tSee Fauvernier et al.

By modeling the CHAMPS data using the misclassification matrix modeling framework proposed in Pramanik et al.

Given a VA-only data for an age group, CCVA algorithm, and country, the package uses the corresponding uncertainty-quantified misclassification matrix estimates as an informative prior, and utilizes the modular VA-calibration to produce calibrated CSMF estimates. It also supports ensemble calibration when VA-only data are provided for multiple algorithms. More generally, the package can be applied to calibrate predictions from a discrete classifier (or ensemble of classifiers) utilizing user-provided fixed or uncertainty-quantified misclassification matrices.

    "description": "Provides a comprehensive framework for building, evaluating, and visualizing regression models for analyzing viral load and CD4 (Cluster of Differentiation 4) lymphocytes data. It leverages the principles of the tidymodels ecosystem of Max Kuhn and Hadley Wickham (2020) <https://www.tidymodels.org> to offer a user-friendly experience in model development. This package includes functions for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, tuning, and evaluation, along with visualization tools to enhance the interpretation of model results. It is specifically designed for researchers in biostatistics, computational biology, and HIV research who aim to perform reproducible and rigorous analyses to gain insights into disease dynamics. The main focus is on improving the understanding of the relationships between viral load, CD4 lymphocytes, and other relevant covariates to contribute to HIV research and the visibility of vulnerable seropositive populations.",
