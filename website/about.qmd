## What is The Warehouse?

The Warehouse is a **function-first R package directory** that helps you find packages by what they do, not just by their names.

### The Problem

With over 22,000 packages on CRAN alone, finding the right package for your task is overwhelming:

- Searching by keywords often misses relevant packages
- No easy way to compare similar packages
- Quality indicators are scattered or missing
- GitHub-only packages are hard to discover

### Our Solution

The Warehouse provides:

- **Function-first search**: "estimate serial interval" → find all relevant packages
- **Quality scores**: Automated assessment of tests, documentation, and maintenance
- **All sources**: CRAN, GitHub, Bioconductor in one place
- **Community reviews**: Real user experiences and recommendations
- **Smart categorization**: Browse by what packages actually do

## How We Calculate Quality Scores

Quality scores (0-100) are calculated from:

- **Documentation (30%)**: README, vignettes, pkgdown site
- **Testing (20%)**: Test coverage and CI status  
- **Maintenance (25%)**: Update frequency and active development
- **Community (25%)**: GitHub stars, downloads, user ratings
