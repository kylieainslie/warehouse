## What is The Warehouse?

The Warehouse is a **function-first R package directory** that helps you find packages by what they do, not just by their names.

### The Problem

With over 22,000 packages on CRAN alone, finding the right package for your task is overwhelming:

- Searching by keywords often misses relevant packages
- No easy way to compare similar packages
- Quality indicators are scattered or missing
- GitHub-only packages are hard to discover

### Our Solution

The Warehouse provides:

- **Function-first search**: "estimate serial interval" → find all relevant packages
- **Quality scores**: Automated assessment of tests, documentation, and maintenance
- **All sources**: CRAN, GitHub, Bioconductor in one place
- **Community reviews**: Real user experiences and recommendations
- **Smart categorization**: Browse by what packages actually do

## Resources & Credits

The Warehouse doesn't aim to reinvent the wheel. The R ecosystem already has excellent resources for package discovery and distribution. We build upon these foundations, adding a unified search experience focused on *what packages do* rather than what they're called.

**Our data sources:**

| Resource | What it provides |
|----------|------------------|
| [R-Universe](https://r-universe.dev) | Package metadata, binaries, and quality metrics for CRAN and GitHub packages |
| [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) | The official R package repository with 20,000+ packages |
| [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) | Curated packages for bioinformatics and computational biology |
| [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) | Peer-reviewed packages for reproducible research |

**What The Warehouse adds:**

- **Unified search** across all sources with AI-powered semantic matching
- **Function-first discovery** — search by what you want to do, not package names
- **Curated categories** for domain-specific workflows (epidemiology, pharma, geospatial, etc.)
- **Community reviews** to share real-world experiences
- **Quality comparisons** to help choose between similar packages

We're grateful to the maintainers of these resources and the broader R community for making package discovery possible.

## How We Calculate Quality Scores

Quality scores (0-100) are calculated from:

- **Documentation (30%)**: README, vignettes, pkgdown site
- **Testing (20%)**: Test coverage and CI status  
- **Maintenance (25%)**: Update frequency and active development
- **Community (25%)**: GitHub stars, downloads, user ratings
